Firefox and Thunderbird install an optional service called the Mozilla Maintenance Service which allows application updates to occur in the background, without requiring you to click Yes in the Windows User Account Control (UAC) dialog.

<img alt=""No UAC"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-04-10-15-55-34-14bfbb.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>
# How does the Mozilla Maintenance Service work?

When Firefox or Thunderbird downloads an application update, the Mozilla Maintenance Service gets permission from Windows to allow the update to be applied, without requiring you to click Yes in the Windows User Account Control (UAC) dialog. Until that time, the service doesn't run, so it doesn't use any computer resources and, once the update process begins, the service quits. For more details, see [this Mozilla Wiki page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Windows_Service_Silent_Update).

**Note:** Firefox also has a feature you can enable that will automatically install updates, even when Firefox is not running. See [this article](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-background-updates-firefox-windows"") for details.

# Disabling the Mozilla Maintenance Service

If you'd like to be prompted to authorize updates, you can disable the Mozilla Maintenance Service as follows:

## Firefox

1. In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click Firefox and then select Preferences or Settings, depending on your macOS version.Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and select Settings.
2. Click the General panel.
3. Scroll down to _Firefox Updates_. ( **Tip:** You can also search for **updates** in the search box.)
4. Uncheck the box next to **Use a background service to install updates**.

## Thunderbird

1. In the menu bar, click the Thunderbird menu and select Settings.Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and choose Settings.
2. In the General panel, scroll down to the _Updates_ section.
3. Uncheck the box next to **Use a background service to install updates**.

# Uninstalling the Mozilla Maintenance Service

You can uninstall the Mozilla Maintenance Service from your computer if you wish.

<h1 id=""w_about-signatures"">About signatures</h1>
<p>There are two basic methods for creating signatures.
Simple text signatures can be directly created in 'Account Settings' for the selected mail account as discussed in the sections below for 'Plain-text signatures' and 'HTML signatures.
</p><p>Simple or more complicated signatures where you desire greater control over positioning of text and perhaps need to include an image can be created in Thunderbirds 'Write' composing window using all the formatting tools available. See the section below 'Sigatures stored in files'.
</p><p>An simple text email signature might say something like:
</p>
<div class=""note"">John Doe
<p>Minion

The Big Example Organization</div>
<p><br>
</p><p>Simple text Signatures are created in Thunderbird's <strong>Account Settings</strong> interface. Click on the menu button The image ""Fx57menu"" does not exist. (or on 'Menu Bar' use <strong><span class=""for"" data-for=""win,mac"">Tools</span><span class=""for"" data-for=""linux"">Edit</span>) &gt; Account Settings</strong>, and then, in the left panel, select the account for which you want to create a signature.

# About signatures

There are two basic methods for creating signatures. Simple text signatures can be directly created in 'Account Settings' for the selected mail account as discussed in the sections below for 'Plain-text signatures' and 'HTML signatures.

Simple or more complicated signatures where you desire greater control over positioning of text and perhaps need to include an image can be created in Thunderbirds 'Write' composing window using all the formatting tools available. See the section below 'Sigatures stored in files'.

An simple text email signature might say something like:

John Doe

Minion

The Big Example Organization

Simple text Signatures are created in Thunderbird's **Account Settings** interface. Click on the menu button The image ""Fx57menu"" does not exist. (or on 'Menu Bar' use **ToolsEdit) \> Account Settings**, and then, in the left panel, select the account for which you want to create a signature.

# Signatures stored in files

Alternatively, in Account Settings, you can upload a file that contains your signature. Check **Attach the signature from a file instead** and then click Choose... to select the file. The file can contain either plain or HTML-formatted text. If you have an HTML-formatted signature, the message recipient must be able to view HTML-formatted messages in their email program. If they have disabled this ability, the signature will be rendered in text format and images will not be displayed.

You can create a signature file by using the Thunderbird composer. As an example, open a new HTML-formatted message window in Thunderbird (File \> New \> Message) or click on Write located on the'Mail Toolbar'. Make sure that the formatting toolbar is displayed.

<dl><dt>

(If it is not displayed, you are composing a message formatted in text, not HTML. To change to HTML, select Options \> Delivery Format \> Rich Text (HTML) Only.)

1. Compose and format your signature as desired. Note that numerous formatting functions are available from the Insert and Format menus.<dl><dt>

2. Click File \> Save As \> File. Choose where to save your HTML file. Make sure Save as Type&nbsp;: ""HTML files"" is selected, and then specify a file name and click Save.
3. Close the message window and discard the message without saving.
4. Open the Account Settings and select the email account in the panel on the left.
5. Check **Attach the signature from a file** , click Choose and navigate to the file you created.

## Including image files in signatures

To include an image file from your local computer in a signature, follow the steps above to create an HTML signature. When you are composing the signature contents, though, use the Insert \> Image menu option to specify the desired image.

<dl><dt>
<img alt=""18b145ed7d093472557cda5e6f9b1477-1270078353-181-1.jpg"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2011-03-14-10-07-38-b906ae.jpg"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>

In addition to selecting the image file, use this dialog to configure other aspects of the image, such as the size, a URL link, its position with regards to the text, etc.

You can also specify an image located on a web server as part of your attachment. Simply specify the image URL in the field where you would otherwise specify the file name. If you check "" **Attach this image to the message**"" the image will be included as an attachment. If you do not attach the image, message recipients must have an internet connection to view the image. Also, keep in mind that for security reasons many people configure their email programs to block remote content, which would prevent the image from displaying unless it was attached to the message.

# Using vCards

[vCard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard) is a file format standard for electronic business cards. vCards can contain name and address information, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, URLs, logos, photographs, etc. If an incoming message has a vCard as an attachment, Thunderbird displays the vCard contents as a signature. Thunderbird can be configured to attach your vCard to outgoing messages (either automatically or on a per-message basis). See [How to use a Virtual Card (vCard)](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-use-virtual-card-vcard"") for instructions.

# Signature position

When you are replying to messages, by default your signature will appear beneath the quoted text at the end of the message. To change this behavior, select ToolsEdit \> Account Settings \> \<account name\> \> Composition & Addressing. Change the reply style to ""Start my reply above the quote"". Next, change the setting for ""and place my signature"" to ""below my reply (above the quote)"".

This setting can be configured for each account and for each identity.

<h1 id=""w_about-keyboard-shortcuts"">About keyboard shortcuts</h1>
<p>In Thunderbird, keyboard shortcuts are context sensitive, which means that they vary according to the area of the Thunderbird interface that is currently ""active"". For example, when a message is selected in the message list, the Cut, Copy, and Paste keyboard shortcuts are disabled (because it doesn't make sense to cut and paste text into the message list). Similarly, if you select text while you are reading a message, the Copy shortcut is available, but not the Cut or Paste shortcuts (because while it makes sense to copy text from a message you are reading, it doesn't make sense to paste text into or cut text from a message you are reading).
</p><p>The keyboard shortcut functions themselves may vary depending on the part of the Thunderbird interface that is active. For example, if you are writing a message, the <span class=""for"" data-for=""win,linux""><span class=""key"">Ctrl</span> + <span class=""key"">A</span></span><span class=""for"" data-for=""mac""><span class=""key"">Command</span> + <span class=""key"">A</span></span> keyboard shortcut selects all the text in the message. However, if a message is highlighted in the message list, <span class=""for"" data-for=""win,linux""><span class=""key"">Ctrl</span> + <span class=""key"">A</span></span><span class=""for"" data-for=""mac""><span class=""key"">Command</span> + <span class=""key"">A</span></span> selects all the messages in the message list.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_shortcut-keys-and-operating-systems"">Shortcut keys and operating systems</h1>
<ul><li>On Windows and Linux, the shortcut accelerator key is usually the <span class=""key"">Ctrl</span> key.
</li><li>On macOS, the shortcut accelerator key is usually the <span class=""key"">Command</span> key.
</li><li>On macOS laptops, you must hold down the <span class=""key"">fn</span> key to enable a function key.

# About keyboard shortcuts

In Thunderbird, keyboard shortcuts are context sensitive, which means that they vary according to the area of the Thunderbird interface that is currently ""active"". For example, when a message is selected in the message list, the Cut, Copy, and Paste keyboard shortcuts are disabled (because it doesn't make sense to cut and paste text into the message list). Similarly, if you select text while you are reading a message, the Copy shortcut is available, but not the Cut or Paste shortcuts (because while it makes sense to copy text from a message you are reading, it doesn't make sense to paste text into or cut text from a message you are reading).

The keyboard shortcut functions themselves may vary depending on the part of the Thunderbird interface that is active. For example, if you are writing a message, the Ctrl + ACommand + A keyboard shortcut selects all the text in the message. However, if a message is highlighted in the message list, Ctrl + ACommand + A selects all the messages in the message list.

# Shortcut keys and operating systems

- On Windows and Linux, the shortcut accelerator key is usually the Ctrl key.
- On macOS, the shortcut accelerator key is usually the Command key.
- On macOS laptops, you must hold down the fn key to enable a function key.

## The problem still happens in Troubleshoot Mode

If the problem still happens in Troubleshoot Mode, then it is not being caused by an extension or theme installed in Thunderbird. Possible causes and solutions include:

- Something wrong with your Windows operating system or operating environment. Please start [Windows in safe mode](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode). If the problem is resolved in Windows safe mode, then the cause is likely a program loaded during windows startup. Possibilities include: antivirus software (AV), virus/malware, background downloads such as Windows or other program updates, to name a few. For AV information see [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Antivirus\_Related\_Performance\_Issues](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Antivirus_Related_Performance_Issues).

- Something wrong with your Thunderbird installation. Please try reinstalling Thunderbird from [https://www.thunderbird.net/](https://www.thunderbird.net/).

<h2 id=""w_archiving-messages"">Archiving messages</h2>
<p>In order to be consistent with Gmail's behavior, Thunderbird archives your message in the <em>All Mail</em> folder, and not in an <em>Archive</em> folder as it does for other accounts (as described in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/archived-messages"">Archived Messages</a> article).
</p>
<dl><dt><img alt=""Gmail Archive settings"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-03-17-04-13-09-41649e.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">

<h2 id=""w_subscribing-to-folders-and-synchronizing-messages"">Subscribing to folders and synchronizing messages</h2>
<h3 id=""w_understanding-gmail-labels-and-thunderbird-folders"">Understanding Gmail labels and Thunderbird folders</h3>
<p>Gmail uses a special implementation of IMAP. In this implementation, Gmail labels become Thunderbird folders. When you apply a label to a message in Gmail, Thunderbird creates a folder with the same name as the label and stores the message in that folder. Similarly, if you move a message to a folder in Thunderbird, Gmail will create a label with the folder name and assign it to the message.
</p><p>If you copy a message to another folder, Gmail will still store only one message but apply both folder names as labels to it. Moving any copy of a message into the Trash will remove all labels from it, and it will no longer appear in any other folder.
</p><p>In the example shown below, the folders at the same level as the <em>[Gmail]</em> folder (<em>Personal</em>, <em>Receipts</em>, <em>Travel</em> and <em>Work</em>) correspond to Gmail labels.
</p>
<dl><dt><img alt=""default gmail folders"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-03-22-16-07-48-8304a9.jpg"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>
<p>There is also a set of special sub-folders for the <em>[Gmail]</em> folder:
</p>
<ul><li> All Mail: contains all the messages of your Gmail account, including sent and archived messages. Any messages that you see in the inbox will also appear in the <em>[Gmail]/All Mail</em> folder.
</li><li> Drafts: contains draft messages.
</li><li> Sent Mail: contains sent messages.
</li><li> Spam: contains messages that were marked as spam (either by Gmail or Thunderbird).
</li><li> Starred: contains messages that were starred (either by Gmail or Thunderbird).
</li><li> Trash: contains deleted messages.
</li><li> Important: contains messages that Gmail has flagged as “important”. (See <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/answer/186531"">Priority Inbox overview</a> for more details about this Gmail feature.)
</li></ul>
<h3 id=""w_subscribing-to-or-unsubscribing-from-folders-labels"">Subscribing to or unsubscribing from folders (labels)</h3>
<p>You can configure which Gmail folders you want to display in Thunderbird. By default, all Gmail folders are displayed, as described above. To configure folder display, right-click the account name and select <span class=""menu"">Subscribe…</span>
</p>
<dl><dt><img alt=""subscribe gmail folders"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-03-22-16-20-21-1f5531.jpg"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>
<p>Uncheck any folders that you don't want to display in Thunderbird. Messages will still be downloaded and available through the <em>All Mail</em> folder. They will also be included in search results. However, the Gmail label (Thunderbird folder) will not be displayed.
</p>
<h3 id=""w_synchronizing-folders-labels"">Synchronizing folders (labels)</h3>
<p>If you want to see all your Gmail labels and messages in Thunderbird but prefer to avoid all the messages being downloaded to your system, you may want to tweak the synchronization settings. This allows you to define which folder should be synchronized. If you don't synchronize a folder, the message header will still be displayed in Thunderbird, but the message content will only be downloaded when you click the message header.
</p><p>To change how messages are downloaded, set synchronization options for the account and for individual folders. (<span class=""for"" data-for=""win,mac""><span class=""menu"">Tools</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Account Settings…</span></span><span class=""for"" data-for=""linux""><span class=""menu"">Edit</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Account Settings…</span></span>) See <a href=""/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization#w_synchronization"">IMAP Synchronization</a> for more information.
</p>
<h3 id=""w_thunderbirds-message-lists-differ-from-the-web-interface"">Thunderbird's message lists differ from the web interface</h3>
<p>If some messages are appearing in your Inbox that shouldn't be, or aren't appearing but should be, you may need to select the <em>Don't override filters</em> option under <span class=""menu"">Inbox</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Filtered mail</span> in Gmail's settings.
The same can be achieved by turning off <span class=""menu"">General</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Smart features and personalisation</span> in Gmail's settings.
</p><p>You can also change whether Gmail's interface should group messages by conversation with the <strong>Conversation View</strong> setting in Gmail's <span class=""menu"">General</span> settings page, to match your <a href=""/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird"">Thunderbird preference</a>.
</p><p>See the support article on <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6562"">how to change Gmail settings</a>.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_updating-a-gmail-account-to-use-oauth"">Updating a Gmail account to use OAuth</h1>
<p>Thunderbird will normally set up or update your Gmail account to OAuth automatically. If something goes wrong, you can use the hints below to check and set up manually. For more details and how to resolve various OAuth issues, see <a href=""/en-US/kb/automatic-conversion-google-mail-accounts-oauth20"">Automatic Conversion of Google mail accounts to OAuth 2.0 Authentication</a>.

# Configuring your Gmail account

<iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/JXs_YE9QyUQ?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To configure Thunderbird to work with Gmail, first ensure IMAP is enabled on your Gmail account (the default for new Gmail accounts). See [Gmail's instructions](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229) for help.

Double check that “Access for less secure apps” is enabled. See [Google's article on “less secure apps”](https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps) for help.

Next, select File \> New \> Existing Mail Account… The _Mail Account Setup_ dialog is displayed. After you provide your account information (real name, email address, password), Thunderbird will automatically configure your Gmail connection. Click Done, sign in with your Google account if prompted. Thunderbird will begin downloading your existing messages.

Lastly, review [Google's recommended settings for Thunderbird](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78892#zippy=%2Cthunderbird) so that your local actions, such as labelling and deleting, correspond to those which Gmail takes and do not cause any conflicts.

For more detailed information, please refer to:

- [Automatic Account Configuration](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-account-configuration"")
- [Gmail's support articles on email clients](https://support.google.com/mail/topic/7280141)

# Gmail's particularities

## Archiving messages

In order to be consistent with Gmail's behavior, Thunderbird archives your message in the _All Mail_ folder, and not in an _Archive_ folder as it does for other accounts (as described in the [Archived Messages](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/archived-messages"") article).

<dl><dt>
<img alt=""Gmail Archive settings"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-03-17-04-13-09-41649e.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>
The Archive options… button is disabled for Gmail accounts, as it is not necessary to define the archive granularity with Gmail.

## Subscribing to folders and synchronizing messages

### Understanding Gmail labels and Thunderbird folders

Gmail uses a special implementation of IMAP. In this implementation, Gmail labels become Thunderbird folders. When you apply a label to a message in Gmail, Thunderbird creates a folder with the same name as the label and stores the message in that folder. Similarly, if you move a message to a folder in Thunderbird, Gmail will create a label with the folder name and assign it to the message.

If you copy a message to another folder, Gmail will still store only one message but apply both folder names as labels to it. Moving any copy of a message into the Trash will remove all labels from it, and it will no longer appear in any other folder.

In the example shown below, the folders at the same level as the _[Gmail]_ folder (_Personal_, _Receipts_, _Travel_ and _Work_) correspond to Gmail labels.

<dl><dt>
<img alt=""default gmail folders"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-03-22-16-07-48-8304a9.jpg"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>

There is also a set of special sub-folders for the _[Gmail]_ folder:

- All Mail: contains all the messages of your Gmail account, including sent and archived messages. Any messages that you see in the inbox will also appear in the _[Gmail]/All Mail_ folder.
- Drafts: contains draft messages.
- Sent Mail: contains sent messages.
- Spam: contains messages that were marked as spam (either by Gmail or Thunderbird).
- Starred: contains messages that were starred (either by Gmail or Thunderbird).
- Trash: contains deleted messages.
- Important: contains messages that Gmail has flagged as “important”. (See [Priority Inbox overview](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/186531) for more details about this Gmail feature.)

### Subscribing to or unsubscribing from folders (labels)

You can configure which Gmail folders you want to display in Thunderbird. By default, all Gmail folders are displayed, as described above. To configure folder display, right-click the account name and select Subscribe…

<dl><dt>
<img alt=""subscribe gmail folders"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-03-22-16-20-21-1f5531.jpg"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>

Uncheck any folders that you don't want to display in Thunderbird. Messages will still be downloaded and available through the _All Mail_ folder. They will also be included in search results. However, the Gmail label (Thunderbird folder) will not be displayed.

### Synchronizing folders (labels)

If you want to see all your Gmail labels and messages in Thunderbird but prefer to avoid all the messages being downloaded to your system, you may want to tweak the synchronization settings. This allows you to define which folder should be synchronized. If you don't synchronize a folder, the message header will still be displayed in Thunderbird, but the message content will only be downloaded when you click the message header.

To change how messages are downloaded, set synchronization options for the account and for individual folders. (Tools \> Account Settings…Edit \> Account Settings…) See [IMAP Synchronization](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization#w_synchronization"") for more information.

### Thunderbird's message lists differ from the web interface

If some messages are appearing in your Inbox that shouldn't be, or aren't appearing but should be, you may need to select the _Don't override filters_ option under Inbox \> Filtered mail in Gmail's settings. The same can be achieved by turning off General \> Smart features and personalisation in Gmail's settings.

You can also change whether Gmail's interface should group messages by conversation with the **Conversation View** setting in Gmail's General settings page, to match your [Thunderbird preference](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird"").

See the support article on [how to change Gmail settings](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6562).

# Updating a Gmail account to use OAuth

Thunderbird will normally set up or update your Gmail account to OAuth automatically. If something goes wrong, you can use the hints below to check and set up manually. For more details and how to resolve various OAuth issues, see [Automatic Conversion of Google mail accounts to OAuth 2.0 Authentication](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-conversion-google-mail-accounts-oauth20"").

The following applies to both POP and IMAP mail accounts.

- Enable cookies in Thunderbird:
  1. Click ≡ \> Settings.
  2. Select Privacy & Security.
  3. Under _Web Content_ section, tick **Accept cookies from sites**.
- You may need to set an exception:
  1. Click Exceptions… button.
  2. Add an exception for **https://accounts.google.com**
  3. Click Allow.
  4. Click Save Changes.
- Change the authentication method in _Account Settings_:
  1. Click ≡ \> Account Settings, which opens in a new tab.

  - Change the Outgoing SMTP authentication method:
    1. In the left pane, select the POP/IMAP account name and look bottom right for _Outgoing Server (SMTP)_.
    2. Click Edit Server SMTP… button.
    3. Set _Authentication Method_ to **OAuth2**.
    4. Click OK.
  - Change the Incoming authentication method:
    1. In the left pane, select Server Settings for Gmail account.
    2. Set _Authentication Method_ to **OAuth2**.

Exit Thunderbird and wait a few moments for background processes to finish. Then restart Thunderbird.

Gmail will prompt you to enter your Gmail email address and password, which is the same password you use to access Gmail webmail account. Follow the instructions to allow Thunderbird to access server.

An OAuth token will get saved in Thunderbird, in the same location as passwords.

</p>
<h1 id=""w_benefits-of-imap"">Benefits of IMAP</h1>
<p>The IMAP protocol supports both online and offline activity. Therefore, messages can be stored both on the local machine and on the server, enabling numerous benefits:
</p>
<ul><li> Multiple clients can be used to access messages. For example, a Thunderbird user with a Microsoft Live account can use both the Thunderbird application that is installed on their system and the web-based interface provided by Microsoft.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Thunderbird users can download their messages to their local system and access them even when they are not connected to the internet. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Messages load faster when they are stored on a local drive. Search performance is much faster than searching a set of messages on a remote server. Full-text search of a message body is only possible on messages that have been downloaded.
</li></ul>
<p>In order to provide this kind of flexibility and functionality, though, messages must be synchronized between the local machine and the email server.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_synchronization"">Synchronization</h1>
<p>To understand message synchronization, consider the following scenarios:
</p>
<ul><li> A message is downloaded to Thunderbird and deleted in Thunderbird. (The message must be deleted from both the local machine and the email server.)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> A message is downloaded to Thunderbird and later deleted by a web-based client (such as Yahoo Mail or Gmail). (The message must be deleted from the Thunderbird message repository.)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> A draft message is composed and saved (but not sent) in Thunderbird. (The draft must be copied from the Thunderbird message repository to the email server.)
</li></ul>
<p>Whenever Thunderbird starts, it checks the state of synchronization between the Thunderbird message repository and the email server, and then performs any transfers that are necessary (such as downloading new messages from the server, deleting from the server any messages that have been deleted locally, etc). Thunderbird continually synchronizes with the email server as long as it is running and has access to the internet. If internet access is lost, Thunderbird will synchronize when access is reestablished.
</p><p>Non-synchronized messages are still accessible within Thunderbird. The only difference is that rather than downloading the entire message, only the message ""headers"" are downloaded. (Message headers contain information like the sender, recipient(s), subject, etc - everything except the body of the message.) The message body is not downloaded until you click on the message in the message list (which means that if you are not online, you can't read the message).
</p><p>Synchronization impacts performance and disk space usage.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_performance-and-search"">Performance and search</h1>
<p>Messages that are stored locally load faster than messages stored on an email server. When messages are stored on an email server, the body of the message is not downloaded until it is invoked (for example by clicking on the message in Thunderbird's message list). Before Thunderbird can display the message body, it must download it from the email server.
</p><p>When Thunderbird has to download many messages from the email server, it can result in a temporary performance lag. This is partially caused by the download process itself, but also caused by the indexing process (whereby the text of messages is analyzed and indexed, enabling fast and powerful message search). Once the downloading and indexing is complete, performance returns to normal. The status of the synchronization is displayed in Thunderbird's bottom left corner.

# The problem suddenly started after updating to Thunderbird version 78... Try this!

Thunderbird 78 expects higher security standards for the so-called TLS network encryption protocol. If your provider does not support the newer versions of the protocol, sending and receiving of messages may fail. You can temporarily lower the bar to check if this is the reason for your problem (which obviously reduces security, so it is not recommended). More details and instructions at [Thunderbird 78 FAQ](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-78-faq#w_after-upgrading-to-thunderbird-78-i-cannot-get-or-send-email-messages"").

# Is your account configured correctly?

To look at the settings for an account, select ToolsEdit \> Account Settings in the Thunderbird menu bar, or click the Application menu button ![New Fx Menu](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and select OptionsPreferences and Account Settings from the sub-menu, then select Server Settings for the account name from the list on the left. The connection to the incoming mail server is configured at the top of the page on the right.

![992c957734e017c49fc78fa508b937ff-1269453233-693-1.jpg](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

Your email account provider can give you connection information about their servers (probably on their website). Make sure your account settings match these settings.

See also:

- [Manual Account Configuration](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manual-account-configuration"") (for instructions on using the New Account dialog for manual configuration)
- [Automatic Account Configuration](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-account-configuration"") (for creating a new account)

# Verify that your incoming email is not being blocked

Verify that your incoming email is not being blocked by your firewall, VPN, proxy, antivirus software (which sometimes implements a proxy and intercepts email) or your Internet Service Provider:

- Try briefly turning off antivirus, VPN, proxy and firewall software, check for new email, and turning them on and check again for email. 

**Note:** Software blocking incoming email is a common cause of not being able to receive messages after updating Thunderbird, since it may be set to trust the previous version of Thunderbird but no longer recognize the updated version as trusted. When this happens, IMAP folders may also disappear. [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Antivirus_Related_Performance_Issues) documents some basic information about antivirus products and their known bad interactions with Thunderbird.
- Remove Thunderbird from your program's list of trusted or recognized programs, then add it back manually or when prompted to resolve this.

# Did your ability to receive mail suddenly stop? Was it working before?

- Check the service status of your ISP. (Many ISPs have a status or alert page on their website.) They may be having technical difficulties. 

- If you use ESET/NOD32 antivirus, and since November 30, 2020 are not getting email or your IMAP folders disappeared, see [https://support.eset.com/en/kb3126-disable-ssl-filtering-in-eset-windows-products](https://support.eset.com/en/kb3126-disable-ssl-filtering-in-eset-windows-products)

- If your ISP provides a web-based email interface, try to log in and view your mail. If you can see your messages, the problem is probably related to your account configuration.

- If you cannot log in to your ISPs web-based email interface, your password may have changed. If so, it must also be changed in Thunderbird. To change your password: 
  - In the menu bar, click the Thunderbird menu and select Settings.Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and choose Settings.
  - On the Security panel, click on the Passwords tab and then click Saved Passwords.... 
  - Click on the relevant account and then click Remove. 
  - Close and re-open Thunderbird. You will be prompted to enter a new password for the account.

- If you recently updated Thunderbird to version 38, check whether you are being impacted by [changes related to Logjam](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-logjam"").

# Are you receiving some emails but not others?

- Does your ISP have a spam filter that might be holding or deleting messages on the server?
- Have you created filters in Thunderbird that might be misfiling messages?

# Are you exceeding mail provider access limits?

- Some mail providers (ISPs) impose limits on account access. For example [Gmail](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-gmail"") limits simultaneous connections to 15 per account (approximately three devices, including phones) and downloads to 2.6 GB per day.

<h1 id=""w_what-is-thunderbird"">What is Thunderbird?</h1>
<p>Thunderbird is a free, open-source, cross-platform application for managing email,  news feeds, chat, and news groups. It is a local email application, meaning it installs and runs as a client on your device, being rather  than browser or web-based. It is powerful yet easy-to-use through its <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/features/"">many features</a>.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_who-makes-thunderbird"">Who makes Thunderbird?</h1>
<p>Thunderbird is developed, tested, translated and supported by volunteers plus paid staff. <strong>Thunderbird is a <u>community</u> driven project</strong>, because the project is overseen by the Thunderbird Council, which is elected by the Thunderbird Community. Thunderbird development is made possible by <a href=""https://donate.mozilla.org/thunderbird/?utm_source=thunderbird.kb&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=header&amp;test=no-img"">funds donated by the Thunderbird community</a>.
</p>
<ul><li> Thunderbird is completely independent of the Mozilla Corporation, the makers of Firefox. But the Mozilla Coperation supports Thunderbird by hosting many of the Thunderbird infrastructure and resources. 
</li></ul>
<h1 id=""w_why-should-i-use-thunderbird"">Why should I use Thunderbird?</h1>
<ul><li> Thunderbird is free. 
</li><li> Thunderbird has many <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/features/"">cool features</a>. 
</li><li> Thunderbird gives <strong>you</strong> control and ownership over your email. 
</li><li> There are many <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/"">add-ons available for Thunderbird</a> to extend and customize your email experience. 
</li><li> Thunderbird's history is with Mozilla, and so it adheres to the <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto"">Mozilla Manifesto</a>, a pledge that describes a commitment to an open, accessible, egalitarian Internet.
</li></ul>
<h1 id=""w_is-thunderbird-free"">Is Thunderbird free?</h1>
<p>Yes! Thunderbird is open source software. Anyone can download and use the program for free, and view and modify the source code under the terms of the <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/"">license</a>.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_where-can-i-download-thunderbird"">Where can I download Thunderbird?</h1>
<p>Download Thunderbird <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/"">here</a>. Or use these links for <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/"">different languages</a>, <a href=""/en-US/kb/thunderbird-beta"">beta versions</a>, <a href=""https://releases.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/"">old versions</a>, and the <a href=""https://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/"">source code</a>.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_is-thunderbird-available-in-my-language"">Is Thunderbird available in my language?</h1>
<p>Very likely, yes. Thunderbird has many dedicated volunteer translators who translate each version. If you do not find your language in <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/"">the download list</a>, then we encourage you <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Thunderbird/Thunderbird_Localization"">to develop a localized version</a> with the help of the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Localization"">community of volunteers</a>. 
</p>
<h1 id=""w_is-thunderbird-available-for-my-platform"">Is Thunderbird available for my platform?</h1>
<p>Probably. Windows, Mac and Linux are available from the <a href=""http://getthunderbird.com"">download page</a>. For other operating systems, you can <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Simple_Thunderbird_build"">build Thunderbird from the source code</a>.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_is-thunderbird-available-for-android"">Is Thunderbird available for Android?</h2>
<p>Android support will be provided per <a href=""https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/06/revealed-thunderbird-on-android-plans-k9/"">an agreement of the K-9 mail project having joined with Thunderbird</a>.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_is-thunderbird-available-for-ios-or-iphone"">Is Thunderbird available for IOS or iPhone?</h2>
<p>IOS / iPhone support is being investigated.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_what-is-my-thunderbird-email-address"">What is my Thunderbird email address?</h1>
<p>Thunderbird is an <strong>application</strong> run on your device, so it does not provide email addresses, nor the service to transmit emails. But Thunderbird can be used with your existing email address and service provider to send, receive, sort and search your email messages.

# What is Thunderbird?

Thunderbird is a free, open-source, cross-platform application for managing email, news feeds, chat, and news groups. It is a local email application, meaning it installs and runs as a client on your device, being rather than browser or web-based. It is powerful yet easy-to-use through its [many features](https://www.thunderbird.net/features/).

# Who makes Thunderbird?

Thunderbird is developed, tested, translated and supported by volunteers plus paid staff. **Thunderbird is a <u>community</u> driven project** , because the project is overseen by the Thunderbird Council, which is elected by the Thunderbird Community. Thunderbird development is made possible by [funds donated by the Thunderbird community](https://donate.mozilla.org/thunderbird/?utm_source=thunderbird.kb&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=header&test=no-img).

- Thunderbird is completely independent of the Mozilla Corporation, the makers of Firefox. But the Mozilla Coperation supports Thunderbird by hosting many of the Thunderbird infrastructure and resources. 

# Why should I use Thunderbird?

- Thunderbird is free. 
- Thunderbird has many [cool features](https://www.thunderbird.net/features/). 
- Thunderbird gives **you** control and ownership over your email. 
- There are many [add-ons available for Thunderbird](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/) to extend and customize your email experience. 
- Thunderbird's history is with Mozilla, and so it adheres to the [Mozilla Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto), a pledge that describes a commitment to an open, accessible, egalitarian Internet.

# Is Thunderbird free?

Yes! Thunderbird is open source software. Anyone can download and use the program for free, and view and modify the source code under the terms of the [license](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/).

# Where can I download Thunderbird?

Download Thunderbird [here](https://www.thunderbird.net/). Or use these links for [different languages](https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/), [beta versions](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-beta""), [old versions](https://releases.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/), and the [source code](https://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/).

# Is Thunderbird available in my language?

Very likely, yes. Thunderbird has many dedicated volunteer translators who translate each version. If you do not find your language in [the download list](https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/), then we encourage you [to develop a localized version](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Thunderbird/Thunderbird_Localization) with the help of the [community of volunteers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Localization).

# Is Thunderbird available for my platform?

Probably. Windows, Mac and Linux are available from the [download page](http://getthunderbird.com). For other operating systems, you can [build Thunderbird from the source code](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Simple_Thunderbird_build).

## Is Thunderbird available for Android?

Android support will be provided per [an agreement of the K-9 mail project having joined with Thunderbird](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/06/revealed-thunderbird-on-android-plans-k9/).

## Is Thunderbird available for IOS or iPhone?

IOS / iPhone support is being investigated.

# What is my Thunderbird email address?

Thunderbird is an **application** run on your device, so it does not provide email addresses, nor the service to transmit emails. But Thunderbird can be used with your existing email address and service provider to send, receive, sort and search your email messages. If you do not have an email address, you may apply to a service provider when you first start Thunderbird.

Common email address and service providers include:

- Internet Service Providers (ISPs): When you sign up for internet access through an ISP they usually give you one or more email accounts. 

- Web-based: Many web sites provide email accounts. These include [Google](https://mail.google.com), [Yahoo!](https://mail.yahoo.com/), [Windows Live Hotmail](https://mail.live.com/), and others. 

- Corporate: Employers often provide their employees with email accounts.

All of these email accounts can be used with Thunderbird. In fact, with Thunderbird you can access mail from multiple accounts at the same time. All you need to do is [set up your account](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-account-configuration"").

# Where is my personal information (such as my messages, passwords, account information, etc) stored?

Thunderbird stores your personal data on your local drive. If you are using the IMAP protocol for accessing messages, then your messages are also stored on your email provider's server. See [IMAP Synchronization](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization"") for more information.

You will want to protect this information by [backing up your profile](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_backing-up-a-profile"").

# Where can I get help with using Thunderbird?

Support is available primarily in these ways:

- The web-based [Knowledge Base of many articles](\""https://support.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird""), for example the article you are reading now.
- Thunderbird's [support forum](\""https://support.mozilla.org/questions/thunderbird"") where you can ask a question, or search for issues and answers if you didn't find the answer in the [Knowledge Base](\""https://support.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird"")
- Various other [communication sources](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/get-involved/#communication), some of which cover special topics.
- For questions or problems about a feature provided by an [add-on](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions"") that you installed in Thunderbird, you will want to find the **Support site** or **Support E-mail** adddress on that add-on's web page.

**Thunderbird does not provide direct support via email, fax, chat, phone, remote, nor paid services** , so [be wary of offers of paid support, and also please report scams that you think are suspicious](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/avoid-and-report-mozilla-tech-support-scams""). Instead we rely on our volunteer community to help users. We hope that you, a Thunderbird user, will become a Thunderbird community member. (See below on how to help.)

# Can I help?

Yes, absolutely! Please do!

- Help other Thunderbird users with [Thunderbird questions](\""https://support.mozilla.org/questions/thunderbird"") and in the [Thunderbird KB](\""https://support.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird"").
- Help [in other ways](https://www.thunderbird.net/get-involved/), such as knowledge base articles, documentation, coding, and testing [beta versions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-beta).

<h1 id=""w_what-is-an-add-on"">What is an add-on?</h1>
<p>Add-ons are extensions and other additions that add new functionality to Thunderbird or change its appearance. Thunderbird has an open, extensible design and program architecture. This enables people to create “add-ons” to Thunderbird.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_who-creates-add-ons"">Who creates add-ons?</h1>
<p>Add-ons are mostly created by volunteer authors, typically <strong>not</strong> the developers of Thunderbird. Thunderbird hosts a site for the distribution of add-ons, but Thunderbird is <strong>not</strong> responsible for supporting add-ons. If you need help with an add-on, you should <a href=""#w_what-if-my-add-on-is-broken"">contact the author of the add-on</a>.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_what-and-where-is-the-add-ons-manager"">What and where is the Add-ons Manager?</h1>
<p>The Add-ons Manager is the central interface to list, update, enable, disable, remove and install add-ons. To open the Add-ons Manager, click the menu button The image ""fx89menuButton"" does not exist. and click <span class=""menu"">Add-ons and Themes</span>.
</p><p>The Add-ons Manager has multiple panels:
</p>
<ul><li> <span class=""menu"">Recommendations</span> : List of popular and recommended add-ons.
</li><li> <span class=""menu"">Extensions</span> : List of installed extensions (add-ons adding functionality to Thunderbird).

</li></ul>
<h1 id=""w_where-do-i-get-add-ons"">Where do I get add-ons?</h1>
<p>Most Thunderbird add-ons are distributed via the <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/"">Thunderbird add-ons site</a> (although authors can distribute their add-ons any way they choose). You can search and browse the add-ons site using a web browser. You can also open the <a href=""#w_what-and-where-is-the-add-ons-manager"">Add-ons Manager</a> and search for add-ons by typing search terms into the search field in the top right corner, or browser the list of recommended add-ons in the <span class=""menu"">Recommendations</span> panel.

# What is an add-on?

Add-ons are extensions and other additions that add new functionality to Thunderbird or change its appearance. Thunderbird has an open, extensible design and program architecture. This enables people to create “add-ons” to Thunderbird.

# Who creates add-ons?

Add-ons are mostly created by volunteer authors, typically **not** the developers of Thunderbird. Thunderbird hosts a site for the distribution of add-ons, but Thunderbird is **not** responsible for supporting add-ons. If you need help with an add-on, you should [contact the author of the add-on](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_what-if-my-add-on-is-broken).

# What and where is the Add-ons Manager?

The Add-ons Manager is the central interface to list, update, enable, disable, remove and install add-ons. To open the Add-ons Manager, click the menu button The image ""fx89menuButton"" does not exist. and click Add-ons and Themes.

The Add-ons Manager has multiple panels:

- Recommendations&nbsp;: List of popular and recommended add-ons.
- Extensions&nbsp;: List of installed extensions (add-ons adding functionality to Thunderbird).
- Themes&nbsp;: List of installed themes (add-ons changing the appearance of Thunderbird).

# Where do I get add-ons?

Most Thunderbird add-ons are distributed via the [Thunderbird add-ons site](https://addons.thunderbird.net/) (although authors can distribute their add-ons any way they choose). You can search and browse the add-ons site using a web browser. You can also open the [Add-ons Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_what-and-where-is-the-add-ons-manager) and search for add-ons by typing search terms into the search field in the top right corner, or browser the list of recommended add-ons in the Recommendations panel.

# How do I see which add-ons are installed?

1. Open the [Add-ons Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_what-and-where-is-the-add-ons-manager).
2. Switch to the Extensions or Themes panel.

# How do I install an add-on?

See [Installing an Add-on in Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-addon-thunderbird"")

# How do I configure add-ons?

1. Open the [Add-ons Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_what-and-where-is-the-add-ons-manager).
2. Switch to the Extensions panel to see all installed extensions (only extensions can be configured).<dl><dt>

</dt></dl>
  - If the add-on provides an options page, the extension entry will have a wrench ![TB102WrenchIcon](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) icon.
3. Click the wrench icon to view or change option settings for the extension.

# How do I change the update behavior of an add-on?

The standard update behavior can be changed by toggling the Update Add-ons Automatically setting in the menu behind the gear icon of the [Add-ons Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_what-and-where-is-the-add-ons-manager).

![MenuUnderCogWheel](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

The update behavior of each add-on can also be set individually:

1. Open the [Add-ons Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_what-and-where-is-the-add-ons-manager).
2. Switch to the Extensions or Themes panel.
3. Click on the name of an add-on to open its management page.
4. Scroll to the Allow automatic updates entry and select _On_ or _Off_ instead of _Default_.

# How do I update an add-on manually?

1. Open the [Add-ons Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_what-and-where-is-the-add-ons-manager).
2. Switch to the Extensions or Themes panel.
3. Click on the gear icon at the top-right corner and then select Check for Updates.
4. The 3-dot-icon of all add-ons which could be updated, will show a small blue dot.
5. Click on the 3-dot-icon and then select Update.

# What if my add-on is broken?

If you updated to a newer version of Thunderbird or are using the [beta version of Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new?title=thunderbird+beta"" ""Page does not exist."") and an add-on is not working or won't install, it is possible that the add-on author does not support that version of Thunderbird and you can contact the author as described below. But it is also possible that the add-on has been abandoned by the author. Thunderbird will inform you whether it is potentially abandoned (defined as not having been updated within the past year), and also whether an alternative add-on is available. You can also use the standalone, web based version of the [Extension Finder](https://extension-finder.thunderbird.net/) tool to find alternative add-ons.

Contact the add-on author for support as documented on the add-on's management page.

1. Open the [Add-ons Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_what-and-where-is-the-add-ons-manager).
2. Switch to the Extensions or Themes panel.
3. Click on the name of the broken add-on.
4. Open the manage information.
5. In the details tab scroll to and open the Homepage entry.
6. The add-on's home page will have a support website and/or support e-mail.

# How do I disable an add-on?

1. Open the [Add-ons Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_what-and-where-is-the-add-ons-manager).
2. Switch to the Extensions or Themes panel.
3. Toggle the slider on the right side of the add-on's entry to disable the add-on and to prevent it from loading.

# How do I uninstall an add-on?

Before uninstalling an add-on, make sure to have backuped all data related to that add-on. All data stored by add-ons will be deleted upon add-on removal.

1. Open the [Add-ons Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_what-and-where-is-the-add-ons-manager).
2. Switch to the Extensions or Themes panel.
3. Click on the 3-dot-icon and then select Remove.

The add-on manager will show an Undo button at the top to restore the add-on (including its data). Once the add-on manager is closed, the add-on has been removed permanently.

# How do I create/develop an add-on?

You may find information on Thunderbird Add-on development on [developer.thunderbird.net](https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/) (DTN).

<h1 id=""w_verify-that-your-outgoing-email-is-not-being-blocked"">Verify that your outgoing email is not being blocked</h1>
<p>Verify that your outgoing email is not being blocked by your firewall, VPN, proxy, antivirus software (which sometimes implements a proxy and intercepts email) or your Internet Service Provider:
</p>
<ul><li> Try briefly turning both antivirus, VPN, proxy and firewall software off, sending a test email, and turning them on and sending another test email.
</li></ul>
<div class=""note"">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Software blocking outgoing email is a common cause of not being able to send messages after updating Thunderbird, since it may be set to trust the previous version of Thunderbird but no longer recognize the updated version as trusted.
</p>
<ul><li> Remove Thunderbird from your program's list of trusted or recognized programs, then add it back manually or when prompted to resolve this.
</li></ul>
</div>
<ul><li> Many ISPs block outgoing email on port 25. You may have to switch to another port (e.g. 587 or 465). Contact your ISP's support to see if they are blocking your outgoing email port.

<p>As of <a href=""/en-US/kb/find-what-version-thunderbird-you-are-using"">version</a> 78, Thunderbird expects higher security standards for the so-called TLS network encryption protocol. If your provider does not support the newer versions of the protocol, sending and receiving of messages may fail. You can temporarily lower the bar to check if this is the reason for your problem (which obviously reduces security, so it's not recommended). More details and instructions here:

# The problem suddenly started after updating to a new major version of Thunderbird?

If your existing configuration suddenly stopped working after updating Thunderbird to a new major version, it might be your Antivirus or Firewall blocking the new version, or your email provider using outdated TLS security protocols. See these sections below:

- [Verify that your outgoing email is not being blocked](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/cannot-send-messages#w_verify-that-your-outgoing-email-is-not-being-blocked)
- [Verify that your mail server supports the minimum version of TLS](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/cannot-send-messages#w_verify-that-your-mail-server-supports-the-minimum-version-of-tls)

# Verify your SMTP outgoing email settings

- In the Thunderbird menu bar, click the ToolsEdit menu and select Account Settings, or click the Application menu button ![New Fx Menu](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and select OptionsPreferences and Account Settings from the sub-menu, and select **Outgoing Server (SMTP)** from the bottom of the list in the left panel. Check that the settings are the same as documented in the article for your mail provider ([Gmail](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-gmail""), [Yahoo](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-yahoo""), [Comcast](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-comcast""), [Hotmail](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-hotmail""), [Sympatico](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-sympatico"")…) **OR**
- Look for an SMTP mail settings article on the mail provider's site. This is usually in the support section of their website; searching for “mail settings” or “SMTP” will usually find it. Check that your Thunderbird settings match the documented settings.

![fbc7355532a508eb55186ebf7bbb1cd1-1277326689-659-1.jpg](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

# Verify the correct SMTP Server is being used

- In the Thunderbird menu bar, click the ToolsEdit menu and select Account Settings, or click the Application menu button ![New Fx Menu](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and select Account Settings, and select the account name. Verify that you are using the right SMTP server for the email address. Most of the time, you cannot send messages from one account provider using another account provider's service. For example, you cannot send a mail from “joe@gmail.com” through Yahoo's SMTP server.

![fbc7355532a508eb55186ebf7bbb1cd1-1277326770-967-1.jpg](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

# Verify that your outgoing email is not being blocked

Verify that your outgoing email is not being blocked by your firewall, VPN, proxy, antivirus software (which sometimes implements a proxy and intercepts email) or your Internet Service Provider:

- Try briefly turning both antivirus, VPN, proxy and firewall software off, sending a test email, and turning them on and sending another test email.

**Note:** Software blocking outgoing email is a common cause of not being able to send messages after updating Thunderbird, since it may be set to trust the previous version of Thunderbird but no longer recognize the updated version as trusted.

- Remove Thunderbird from your program's list of trusted or recognized programs, then add it back manually or when prompted to resolve this.

- Many ISPs block outgoing email on port 25. You may have to switch to another port (e.g. 587 or 465). Contact your ISP's support to see if they are blocking your outgoing email port.

# Verify that your mail server supports the minimum version of TLS

As of [version](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-what-version-thunderbird-you-are-using"") 78, Thunderbird expects higher security standards for the so-called TLS network encryption protocol. If your provider does not support the newer versions of the protocol, sending and receiving of messages may fail. You can temporarily lower the bar to check if this is the reason for your problem (which obviously reduces security, so it's not recommended). More details and instructions here:

[Thunderbird 78 FAQ – After upgrading to Thunderbird 78, I cannot get or send email messages](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-78-faq#w_after-upgrading-to-thunderbird-78-i-cannot-get-or-send-email-messages"")

# Delete SMTP Password

Try [deleting your SMTP password](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/configuration-options-security#w_view-or-delete-passwords-for-email-accounts""). However, don't do this as a first step, especially if you cannot send messages after updating Thunderbird while you previously could. In such case, usually there is nothing wrong with a stored SMTP password in Thunderbird (see above).

# Reset SMTP Password

Try changing your SMTP password. This is usually done via a “reset email password” form on your ISP's support website.

# If this list doesn't help

Please [create a _new_ support request](https://support.mozilla.org/questions/new/thunderbird) with a screenshot of your SMTP settings with your user ID obscured, and include the following information: your mail provider (for example, Gmail), ISP (for example, Comcast), firewall version (if any), antivirus software and version (if any), operating system and version (for example, Windows 11 or macOS 14 Sonoma), and [Thunderbird version](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-what-version-thunderbird-you-are-using"") (for example, Thunderbird 115.6.0).

<h2 id=""w_importing-windows-mail-contacts"">Importing Windows Mail Contacts</h2>
<p>In order to import Windows contacts into Thunderbird, you must export the contacts to vCard files (.vcf format) and import the files into Thunderbird. 
</p>
<ol><li> In Windows Live Mail, open the Contacts and select all the contacts you wish to export. 
</li><li> Click on <span class=""menu"">Export &gt; Business Card (.VCF)</span>.
</li><li> Select an empty directory to save these to.
</li></ol>
<p>In Thunderbird, install the <a href=""https://freeshell.de/~kaosmos/morecols-en.html"">MoreFunctionsForAddressBook</a> add-on following <a href=""/en-US/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_how-do-i-install-an-add-on"">these instructions</a>.

</li><li> Browse to the folder where you exported your contacts to.
</li><li> Select all the contacts you wish to import.
</li><li> Click <span class=""button"">Open</span> to import all selected contacts.
</li></ol>
<p>Alternatively, if this does not work or is not supported in your case, you can try this:
</p><p>See the <a href=""https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-contacts-from-outlook-10f09abd-643c-4495-bb80-543714eca73f"">Export contacts from Outlook</a> article at <a href=""http://Microsoft.com"">Microsoft.com</a> for instructions on how to export contacts in Windows.
</p><p>After creating the required file, you can import your contacts using the import wizard:
</p>
<ol><li> In Thunderbird, go to <span class=""menu"">Tools &gt; Import…</span>.
</li><li> Choose Address Books and click <span class=""button"">Next</span>.
</li><li> Choose <em>Text file (LDIF, .tab, .csv, .txt)</em> and click <span class=""button"">Next</span>.
</li><li> Choose <em>Comma Separated</em> (or <em>All files</em>) in the drop-down list at the bottom right, browse to the .csv file you just created, select it and click Open.
</li><li> Wait for the import to finish and click <span class=""button"">Finish</span>.
</li></ol>
<p>In the Import Address Book window that appears, use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to match the address book fields on the left to the correct data for import on the right, and uncheck items you do not want to import. When you are done, click OK. Your contacts should now be imported and ready for use in Thunderbird.
</p><p>Note that if you are having problems importing the fields properly (like when all record data to import shows up inside the first field row when inside the Import Address Book window), this is probably a result of an exported .csv file containing semicolons instead of commas, or the other way around. This usually happens because the separator in Windows Regional settings does not match the one for the Thunderbird locale, for instance when you exported a .csv file using an English Windows version and try to import it into a non-English version of Thunderbird. In this case, you should make the list separator match in your Regional settings before exporting the .csv file, or you could edit the already exported .csv file using a text editor and replace all semicolons by commas (or vice versa), and retry the import step.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_importing-from-outlook-and-eudora"">Importing from Outlook and Eudora</h1>
<p>The normal Thunderbird import process requires that you have Eudora or Outlook installed on your computer. If you do not have them installed, there are alternatives as noted below.
</p><p>To use Thunderbird's import wizard, you must use an older version of Thunderbird, because the wizard is disabled for Outlook and Eudora in Thunderbird version 38 and newer versions. Install <a href=""https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/31.8.0/win32/en-US/"">version 31.8</a>, import your data, then upgrade to the latest version of Thunderbird via the built-in <a href=""/en-US/kb/updating-thunderbird"">update mechanism</a>.  
</p><p>For Eudora, if you have data problems or crashes, try an even <a href=""http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/17.0.9esr/win32/en-US/"">older version of Thunderbird</a> and a tool to clean the data. An example of a data cleaning tool for Mac OS is <a href=""http://andreasamann.com/MacOSX/Eudora_Mailbox_Cleaner"">Eudora Mailbox Cleaner</a>.
</p><p>An alternative to Thunderbird's import wizard is to find a tool to transform your data to mbox format (.mbx), and then use <a href=""https://freeshell.de//~kaosmos/mboximport-en.html"">Import Export Tools</a> add-on in Thunderbird to import the mbox files. One such mbox conversion tool for Eudora is <a href=""http://qwerky.50webs.com/eudorarescue/"">Eudora Rescue</a>.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_eudora-is-not-installed"">Eudora is not installed</h2>
<p>If Eudora is not installed and you want to use the Thunderbird import wizard, you can easily change the Windows registry to point to your Eudora files, then run the import wizard.  
</p>
<ul><li> Create a <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/310516"">.reg file</a> called eudora.reg containing the following lines. Replace H:\\SCRATCH\\Eudoradata with the location of your Eudora data. (note the double backslashes and the blank line)

<p>The following instructions describe how to import messages and contacts from Evolution.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_importing-evolution-messages"">Importing Evolution Messages</h2>
<p>Thunderbird and Evolution use the same file format (called mbox) to store your mails, so its not difficult to import them manually.
</p>
<ol><li>Open Nautilus.
</li><li>Open <span class=""filepath"">~/.local/share/evolution/mail/local</span> which is where Evolution store your mails.
</li><li>Copy all the file without extension (such as <strong>Inbox</strong>, <strong>Outbox</strong>,..) into the emplacement used by Thunderbird to store its mail (something like <span class=""filepath"">~/.thunderbird/uk41lql0.default/Mail/Local Folders</span>,where you need to adapt <em>uk41lql0.default</em> to your own installation).
</li><li>Launch Thunderbird to check that all your mail have been correctly imported.
</li></ol>
<h2 id=""w_importing-evolution-contacts"">Importing Evolution Contacts</h2>
<ol><li>Open your address book in Evolution, right-click on it and choose: <strong>Save as vcard…</strong> to export it into vCard file format.
</li><li>In Thunderbird, open the <span class=""menu"">Tools &gt; Import…</span> menu, select <strong>Address Books</strong> and then <strong>vCard file (.vcf)</strong> and select your contact file. 
</li></ol>
</div>
<h1 id=""w_switching-from-web-based-email-applications-to-thunderbird"">Switching from Web-based Email Applications to Thunderbird</h1>
<p>If you are using a web-based application provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to access your email, you probably only need to configure your account information to switch to Thunderbird. See <a class=""new"" href=""/en-US/kb/new?title=Configure+an+Account"" title=""Page does not exist."">Configure an Account</a> for instructions.
</p><p>Once you have configured your account in Thunderbird, you should be able to access all your messages (both incoming and sent). However, your address book (contacts), mail filters and other settings will not be automatically transferred to Thunderbird. 
</p><p>Some web-base email applications allow you to export contacts in text or comma-separated formats. Check your ISP's documentation for more information. To import contacts into Thunderbird, select <span class=""menu"">Tools &gt; Import…</span> and follow the instructions on the screen.

# Switching from Apple Mail to Thunderbird

Thunderbird can import your messages and OS X address book, but it cannot import your account settings. (Currently, message and address book import is only functional with Apple Mail 5.0 or earlier.)

## Importing Apple Mail messages

1. On the menu bar, open the Tools menu and click on Import. The import wizard will open.  
  
 ![mac-toolsimport](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)   
  
2. Select **Mail** then click Next.  
  
 ![mac-importwizard](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)   
  
3. Select **Apple Mail** then click Next.  
  
 ![mac-importmail](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)   
  
4. You will see a log of successfully imported folders, then click Finish to close the import wizard.  
  
 ![mac-mailimportedsuccess](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

Your imported messages will appear in the Local Folders account, in a folder called ""_Apple Mail Import_"".  
 ![mac-whereimportedmail](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

## Importing the OS X address book

Thunderbird will read your OS X address book and display it in the Thunderbird address book window! From the menu bar, open the Window menu and click on Address Book. Your OS X address book will appear in the left pane.  
 ![mac-OSXaddressbook](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

If you want to import it to the Thunderbird address book, just drag and drop entries from the Mac OS X address book folder to the Personal Address Book.

**Note:** You can select all entries at once by holding down the command key and pressing A.

# Switching from Windows Mail or Windows Live Mail to Thunderbird

Windows Mail is the default mail client included with Windows Vista. Windows Live Mail is the email client bundled with Windows Live Essentials. Both client programs store emails in the .eml file format. In order to export messages from Windows Mail or Windows Live Mail to Thunderbird, you must export messages from the Windows application and import them into Thunderbird. A similar method is needed to export contacts from Windows Mail or Windows Live Mail to Thunderbird.

To find the location of the email files in Windows Mail or Windows Live Mail, go to Tools \> Options \> Advanced \> Maintenance \> Store Folder.

If you do not see Tools, try File \> Options \> Mail… \> Advanced \> Maintenance… instead.

## Importing Windows Mail Messages

Importing Windows Mail (.eml files) into Thunderbird is enabled by the third-party add-on ImportExport Tools. [Download](https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools/) and install this add-on to transfer messages from Windows Live Mail to Thunderbird.

1. Export your messages from Windows Mail in .eml format.
2. In Thunderbird, create a folder in ""Local Folders"" to hold your imported mail and select it.
3. Right click the folder and select ImportExportTools \> Import all messages from a directory \> also from its subdirectories.
4. Navigate to the .eml files folder. The default location for Windows Live mail is C:\Users\\<username\>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail (or \Windows Mail).
5. Click Open. Your data will be imported.

**Note:** To be able to see the ""AppData"" folder, you must change the Folder Options to ""Show hidden files, folders, and drives"" first. See the Microsoft Support article [Show hidden files](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14201/windows-show-hidden-files) for more information.

## Importing Windows Mail Contacts

In order to import Windows contacts into Thunderbird, you must export the contacts to vCard files (.vcf format) and import the files into Thunderbird.

1. In Windows Live Mail, open the Contacts and select all the contacts you wish to export. 
2. Click on Export \> Business Card (.VCF).
3. Select an empty directory to save these to.

In Thunderbird, install the [MoreFunctionsForAddressBook](https://freeshell.de/~kaosmos/morecols-en.html) add-on following [these instructions](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_how-do-i-install-an-add-on"").

1. Click on Address Book.
2. Click on the address book you wish to import the contacts into.
3. Click Tools \> MoreFunctionsForAddressBook \> Actions for Contacts \> Import vCard / VCF.
4. Browse to the folder where you exported your contacts to.
5. Select all the contacts you wish to import.
6. Click Open to import all selected contacts.

Alternatively, if this does not work or is not supported in your case, you can try this:

See the [Export contacts from Outlook](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-contacts-from-outlook-10f09abd-643c-4495-bb80-543714eca73f) article at [Microsoft.com](http://Microsoft.com) for instructions on how to export contacts in Windows.

After creating the required file, you can import your contacts using the import wizard:

1. In Thunderbird, go to Tools \> Import….
2. Choose Address Books and click Next.
3. Choose _Text file (LDIF, .tab, .csv, .txt)_ and click Next.
4. Choose _Comma Separated_ (or _All files_) in the drop-down list at the bottom right, browse to the .csv file you just created, select it and click Open.
5. Wait for the import to finish and click Finish.

In the Import Address Book window that appears, use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to match the address book fields on the left to the correct data for import on the right, and uncheck items you do not want to import. When you are done, click OK. Your contacts should now be imported and ready for use in Thunderbird.

Note that if you are having problems importing the fields properly (like when all record data to import shows up inside the first field row when inside the Import Address Book window), this is probably a result of an exported .csv file containing semicolons instead of commas, or the other way around. This usually happens because the separator in Windows Regional settings does not match the one for the Thunderbird locale, for instance when you exported a .csv file using an English Windows version and try to import it into a non-English version of Thunderbird. In this case, you should make the list separator match in your Regional settings before exporting the .csv file, or you could edit the already exported .csv file using a text editor and replace all semicolons by commas (or vice versa), and retry the import step.

# Importing from Outlook and Eudora

The normal Thunderbird import process requires that you have Eudora or Outlook installed on your computer. If you do not have them installed, there are alternatives as noted below.

To use Thunderbird's import wizard, you must use an older version of Thunderbird, because the wizard is disabled for Outlook and Eudora in Thunderbird version 38 and newer versions. Install [version 31.8](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/31.8.0/win32/en-US/), import your data, then upgrade to the latest version of Thunderbird via the built-in [update mechanism](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/updating-thunderbird"").

For Eudora, if you have data problems or crashes, try an even [older version of Thunderbird](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/17.0.9esr/win32/en-US/) and a tool to clean the data. An example of a data cleaning tool for Mac OS is [Eudora Mailbox Cleaner](http://andreasamann.com/MacOSX/Eudora_Mailbox_Cleaner).

An alternative to Thunderbird's import wizard is to find a tool to transform your data to mbox format (.mbx), and then use [Import Export Tools](https://freeshell.de//~kaosmos/mboximport-en.html) add-on in Thunderbird to import the mbox files. One such mbox conversion tool for Eudora is [Eudora Rescue](http://qwerky.50webs.com/eudorarescue/).

## Eudora is not installed

If Eudora is not installed and you want to use the Thunderbird import wizard, you can easily change the Windows registry to point to your Eudora files, then run the import wizard.

- Create a [.reg file](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/310516) called eudora.reg containing the following lines. Replace H:\\SCRATCH\\Eudoradata with the location of your Eudora data. (note the double backslashes and the blank line)

`
`

    === Registry file, adjust file location as required ===
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

`
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Qualcomm\Eudora\CommandLine]
""Current""=""Anything H:\\SCRATCH\\Eudoradata Anything""
===

`

``

- In a Windows command prompt, run ""regedit /s eudora.reg"".
- Use the Thunderbird import wizard.

# Switching from Evolution to Thunderbird

The following instructions describe how to import messages and contacts from Evolution.

## Importing Evolution Messages

Thunderbird and Evolution use the same file format (called mbox) to store your mails, so its not difficult to import them manually.

1. Open Nautilus.
2. Open ~/.local/share/evolution/mail/local which is where Evolution store your mails.
3. Copy all the file without extension (such as **Inbox** , **Outbox** ,..) into the emplacement used by Thunderbird to store its mail (something like ~/.thunderbird/uk41lql0.default/Mail/Local Folders,where you need to adapt _uk41lql0.default_ to your own installation).
4. Launch Thunderbird to check that all your mail have been correctly imported.

## Importing Evolution Contacts

1. Open your address book in Evolution, right-click on it and choose: **Save as vcard…** to export it into vCard file format.
2. In Thunderbird, open the Tools \> Import… menu, select **Address Books** and then **vCard file (.vcf)** and select your contact file. 

# Switching from Web-based Email Applications to Thunderbird

If you are using a web-based application provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to access your email, you probably only need to configure your account information to switch to Thunderbird. See [Configure an Account](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new?title=Configure+an+Account"" ""Page does not exist."") for instructions.

Once you have configured your account in Thunderbird, you should be able to access all your messages (both incoming and sent). However, your address book (contacts), mail filters and other settings will not be automatically transferred to Thunderbird.

Some web-base email applications allow you to export contacts in text or comma-separated formats. Check your ISP's documentation for more information. To import contacts into Thunderbird, select Tools \> Import… and follow the instructions on the screen.

</li><li>You can leave the uncompressed folder in your <em>download</em> folder, or move it to another place in your account. For example:<br><code>mv thunderbird ~/thunderbird</code>
</li><li>Thunderbird is now ready to be used. You can run it directly from the terminal:<br><code>~/thunderbird/thunderbird &amp;</code>
</li><li>Create a desktop shortcut. Note this step may be different in your Linux distribution.

The [Thunderbird flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/org.mozilla.Thunderbird) package is maintained directly by the Thunderbird staff, as well as the tarballs (see the [official 115 announcement](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/07/our-fastest-most-beautiful-release-ever-thunderbird-115-supernova-is-here/)).

To install Thunderbird from Flatpak, you will need to install flatpak and setup flathub if your system does not already have this. Flathub is the central repository for flatpaks and contains well maintained [instructions on setting up flatpak installs for various distributions](https://flathub.org/setup).

Once flatpak and flathub are all set up, you can either download and install it all from the command line, or separately download the _flatpakref_ file and head to the command line to install it.

## How to install with the command line (easier and much cooler)

`
flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.Thunderbird
`

## How to install with the Graphical User Interface

1. Visit [Thunderbird on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.mozilla.Thunderbird).
2. Click Install and follow the instructions. You can find more options in the dropdown menu next to that button, if necessary.

# Install from Snap

The [Thunderbird snap](https://snapcraft.io/thunderbird) package is currently maintained by Canonical.

To install Thunderbird from Snap:

1. [Install Snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd) on your computer.
2. Visit [Snapcraft's Store page](https://snapcraft.io/thunderbird).
3. Click Install and follow the instructions.

# Installing from your distribution package manager

To install Thunderbird using your distribution package manager, please refer to your Linux distribution's documentation. This method has the benefit of ensuring that Thunderbird and all the required libraries are installed and configured optimally for your distribution.

However, there may be a delay between when your distribution provides a new version or update, and when an official new version or update is available at [Thunderbird.net](https://www.thunderbird.net) or in the flatpak. Your distribution may also provide Thunderbird without the Thunderbird branding.

# Installing Thunderbird manually (For advanced users)

**WARNING** : This instruction set is specifically useful for the adventurous users that wish to install Thunderbird beta or daily. It is also useful in some troubleshooting scenarios. Unless you know what you are doing and are familiar with using a command line, please install Thunderbird through your distro’s repositories

**NOTE: Before you install Thunderbird manually** , please make sure that your computer has the **[required libraries](https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/system-requirements/)** installed. Missing libraries may cause Thunderbird to be inoperable.

## Thunderbird channels

In general, there is a _stable_ Thunderbird release, a _Beta_ Thunderbird, and a _Daily_ (also known as _Nightly_) Thunderbird. This section will show you where to get each of these.

### Thunderbird stable release

As stated before, if you are looking to install the latest stable release of Thunderbird, you should consider using the flatpak or installing it from your distro’s repositories. For a complete list of trusted sources of Thunderbird stable, please refer to [Well known sources for downloading the Thunderbird email software](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/well-known-sources-for-downloading-thunderbird"").

### Thunderbird Beta

If you would like to install Thunderbird Beta, please see our page on [Thunderbird beta](https://www.thunderbird.net/download/beta/) and click on the Download Beta button at the top of the page to download the latest beta tarball.

You may choose where to unpack this tarball based on the type of installation you would like, system or local (see below for both instruction sets).

### Thunderbird Daily (aka Nightly)

If you need more adventure in your life, go try out Thunderbird Daily. Similar to beta, download the appropriate nightly build tarball and unpack it in a location suitable for your type of installation, whether system or local (see below for both instruction sets).

## Installation location

When installing Thunderbird manually, you can choose to install it either in the system or home folder. Below you will find instructions for both.

### System Thunderbird installation (for advanced users)

- To install Thunderbird with this method, you **must be** able to login as root or execute `sudo` commands.
- This installation will have priority over the Thunderbird version installed through your package manager. To run the version installed with your package manager, you will need to execute the binary from a terminal. To do so in most distributions, open a terminal and type: `/usr/bin/thunderbird`. 

1. Download the Thunderbird you’d like to install: stable, beta, or daily (see above for links to those download locations). It will be in the form of _thunderbird-\<version\>.tar.bz2_.
2. Open a terminal and go to the folder where your download has been saved. For example:  
`cd ~/Downloads`
3. Extract the downloaded file contents. This will create a folder named _thunderbird_. After that, you can delete the archive:  
`tar xjf thunderbird-*.tar.bz2rm thunderbird-*.tar.bz2`
4. Move the uncompressed Thunderbird folder to /opt:  
`sudo mv thunderbird /opt`
5. Create a symlink to the Thunderbird executable:  
`sudo ln -s /opt/thunderbird/thunderbird /usr/local/bin/thunderbird`
6. Download a copy of the desktop file:  
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/sumo-kb/main/installing-thunderbird-linux/thunderbird.desktop -P /usr/local/share/applications`

Alternatively, if `wget` is not installed on your computer, go to the URL mentioned above, right-click on the page to open the contextual menu and select Save Page As. After you downloaded the file, move it to /usr/local/share/applications.

To confirm everything is installed correctly, open Thunderbird from the newly created desktop file, and go to ≡ \> Help \> Troubleshooting Information. In the _Application Basics_ section of the _Troubleshooting Information_ page, the value of _Application Binary_ should be `/opt/thunderbird/thunderbird-bin`

### Local Thunderbird installation in a user's account

If you don't have access to login as root or execute `sudo` commands, or just prefer to use a local Thunderbird in your account, you can make a local installation. You can also do this to have multiple Thunderbird installations for different builds.

1. Download the Thunderbird you’d like to install: stable, beta, or daily (see above for links to those download locations). It will be in the form of `thunderbird-<version>.tar.bz2`.
2. Open a terminal and go to the folder where your download has been saved. For example:  
`cd ~/Downloads`
3. Extract the downloaded file contents. This will create a folder named _thunderbird_. After that, you can delete the archive:  
`tar xjf thunderbird-*.tar.bz2rm thunderbird-*.tar.bz2`
4. If you have downloaded a specific build, you may want to rename the uncompressed folder accordingly. For example:  
`mv thunderbird thunderbird-beta`
5. You can leave the uncompressed folder in your _download_ folder, or move it to another place in your account. For example:  
`mv thunderbird ~/thunderbird`
6. Thunderbird is now ready to be used. You can run it directly from the terminal:  
`~/thunderbird/thunderbird &`
7. Create a desktop shortcut. Note this step may be different in your Linux distribution. (Some Linux distros will allow you to right-click on the desktop and choose Create launcher from the context menu):  
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/sumo-kb/main/installing-thunderbird-linux/thunderbird.desktop -P ~/.local/bin/thunderbird`
8. Since the icon for the desktop shortcut will be found in ~/thunderbird/chrome/icons/default/ and the executable is in ~/thunderbird, we need to change these lines in our desktop file that we just downloaded:  
`sed -i.bak -e ""s|Exec=thunderbird %u|Exec=$HOME/thunderbird/thunderbird %u|"" $HOME/.local/share/applications/thunderbird.desktopsed -i.bak -e ""s|Icon=/opt/thunderbird/chrome/icons/default/default128.png|Icon=$HOME/thunderbird/chrome/icons/default/default128.png|"" $HOME/.local/share/applications/thunderbird.desktop`

Now, your Thunderbird application icon should be found among your other applications and you can launch Thunderbird as you expect.

**Note** : This method doesn't change file types binding on the system, so _mailto_ links from other applications will not open in the local installation. You will need to copy the email address and paste it manually in Thunderbird.

<h1 id=""w_how-thunderbird-stores-messages"">How Thunderbird stores messages</h1>
<p>Thunderbird has two storage methods for folders:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox"">MBOX</a> is the default format, where all of a folder's messages are stored in a single file on disk. This is where the compact process is useful, and the purpose of this article is to explain how and why.
</li><li> <a href=""/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird"">Maildir</a> is a newer storage format, where every message of a folder is a separate file. Maildir does not need compact, and so this article is not applicable to Maildir folders.
</li></ul>
<h1 id=""w_what-compact-does-not-do"">What compact does not do</h1>
<p>Compact (purge) is a <u>maintenance</u> process, so it:
</p>
<ul><li> does <strong>not</strong> delete messages from folders
</li><li> does <strong>not</strong> remove messages from trash or spam folders
</li><li> does <strong>not</strong> compress folders by using compression algorithms such as zip
</li></ul>
<p>You may be concerned that the compact prompt sometimes appears just when you have deleted a message, or when you have started Thunderbird. This is expected behavior and is not cause for concern, because compact does <strong>not</strong> delete your messages.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_is-it-ok-to-compact"">Is it OK to compact?</h1>
<p>Compact (purge) is normal maintenance (for the <a href=""#w_why-is-compact-required"">reasons</a> described below), and so it is OK to allow a compact to proceed.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_the-compact-folders-prompt"">The <em>Compact Folders</em> prompt</h1>
<p>The <em>Compact Folders</em> prompt appears when the compact threshold has been reached.
</p><p><img alt=""TB91-compact-folders-prompt"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2021-08-09-11-07-18-81e1a8.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</p><p>You can choose <span class=""button"">Compact now</span> to allow compacting to proceed, or <span class=""button"">Remind me later</span> if the prompt came at an inconvenient time (in Thunderbird 78, the respective buttons were <strong>Proceed</strong> and <strong>Cancel</strong>). The prompt also has a checkbox: <span class=""menu"">☐ Compact folders automatically in the future</span>. To avoid being prompted again, you can tick this option and choose <span class=""button"">Compact now</span> (<strong>Proceed</strong> in Thunderbird 78) - then compacting will happen automatically in the background when necessary. If you do not wish to be prompted, we suggest you use the checkbox.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_why-is-compact-required"">Why is compact required?</h1>
<p>Folders are stored by default in <a href=""#w_how-thunderbird-stores-messages"">MBOX format</a>, and these need periodic cleaning because your daily usage of Thunderbird involves:
</p>
<ul><li> Adding messages to a folder, such as receiving new mail, which makes the MBOX file larger. 
</li><li> Deleting messages, or filtering or moving them to another folder, which does *not* immediately make the MBOX file smaller. The folder does not get smaller because, for performance reasons, a deleted message is only logically marked for deletion. It becomes a gap which you can longer access, and the gaps, like bits if dirt, are eventually removed (purged) with a compact operation.
</li></ul>
<div class=""note""><strong>Note:</strong> Compact does not apply to accounts using the <a href=""/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird"">Maildir</a> storage format. Unlike MBOX, Maildir stores each message in a separate file, and deleting a message results in deleting the message file.</div>
<h1 id=""w_when-does-compact-occur"">When does compact occur?</h1>
<p>A compact happens when:
</p>
<ul><li> You right-click a folder and select <span class=""menu"">Compact</span> to compact a single folder
</li><li> You select <span class=""menu"">File &gt; Compact Folders</span> to compact all folders in an account
</li><li> The amount of disk space to be freed by removing the gaps exceeds the threshold for automatic compact (<a href=""#w_how-can-i-configure-compact"">configuration</a> described below). Because deleting messages causes these gaps, you will often see the <em>Compact Folders</em> prompt just after deleting a message.
</li></ul>
<h1 id=""w_how-can-i-configure-compact"">How can I configure compact?</h1>
<p><span class=""button"">≡</span> &gt; <span class=""menu""><span class=""for"" data-for=""mac,linux"">Preferences</span><span class=""for"" data-for=""win"">Preferences (formerly Options)</span></span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Network &amp; Disk Space</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Disk Space</span>
</p><p>In the preferences, you can:
</p>
<ul><li> Disable automatic compact (not recommended because your folders will not be regularly cleaned of deleted messages)
</li><li> Change the compact threshold - a higher value will result in less frequent compacts (for example, if you deal with large messages or a large volume of messages, then you may want use a larger threshold)
</li><li> Choose if you want to get prompted or if you prefer automatic compacting without prompts (new in Thunderbird 91). Note: The checkbox in the preferences and the corresponding checkbox in the prompt will have reverse values because they are worded differently.
</li></ul>

</p><p><br>
</p>
<h1 id=""w_how-does-compact-work"">How does compact work?</h1>
<p>Thunderbird opens the MBOX file on the disk (for example, the <em>Inbox</em>), and based on the rules for the MBOX mail format it reads the file one message at a time:
</p>
<ul><li> If the message is still current, it is copied to a new temporary MBOX file, called <span class=""filepath"">Nstmp</span>.
</li><li> If the message was marked as deleted or moved, that message is skipped and not moved to the mtemporary MBOX file.
</li></ul>
<p>This repeats until the end of the file is reached. Then the original storage file is deleted, the new one replaces it, and a new index for this message file is created (for example <span class=""filepath"">Inbox.msf</span>). The end result is the gaps (the dirt) are gone.
</p><p>During compact the progress is displayed in the Status Bar:<br><br>
<img alt=""Compacting folder message"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-10-22-13-52-28-40b0f2.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title=""""> 
</p>
<h1 id=""w_potential-complications"">Potential complications</h1>
<p>Most users will experience no complications during or after the compact process. But because compact involves signficiant IO activity, some users might experience folder issues or slowness, even moreso if antivirus software monitoring is not excluding your <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"">Thunderbird profile directory</a>.

Compacting is a regular file maintenance process (sometimes referred to as ""purging"") which recovers disk space without changing or removing any of your messages.

# How Thunderbird stores messages

Thunderbird has two storage methods for folders:

- [MBOX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) is the default format, where all of a folder's messages are stored in a single file on disk. This is where the compact process is useful, and the purpose of this article is to explain how and why.
- [Maildir](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird"") is a newer storage format, where every message of a folder is a separate file. Maildir does not need compact, and so this article is not applicable to Maildir folders.

# What compact does not do

Compact (purge) is a <u>maintenance</u> process, so it:

- does **not** delete messages from folders
- does **not** remove messages from trash or spam folders
- does **not** compress folders by using compression algorithms such as zip

You may be concerned that the compact prompt sometimes appears just when you have deleted a message, or when you have started Thunderbird. This is expected behavior and is not cause for concern, because compact does **not** delete your messages.

# Is it OK to compact?

Compact (purge) is normal maintenance (for the [reasons](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/compacting-folders#w_why-is-compact-required) described below), and so it is OK to allow a compact to proceed.

# The _Compact Folders_ prompt

The _Compact Folders_ prompt appears when the compact threshold has been reached.

![TB91-compact-folders-prompt](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

You can choose Compact now to allow compacting to proceed, or Remind me later if the prompt came at an inconvenient time (in Thunderbird 78, the respective buttons were **Proceed** and **Cancel** ). The prompt also has a checkbox: ☐ Compact folders automatically in the future. To avoid being prompted again, you can tick this option and choose Compact now ( **Proceed** in Thunderbird 78) - then compacting will happen automatically in the background when necessary. If you do not wish to be prompted, we suggest you use the checkbox.

# Why is compact required?

Folders are stored by default in [MBOX format](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/compacting-folders#w_how-thunderbird-stores-messages), and these need periodic cleaning because your daily usage of Thunderbird involves:

- Adding messages to a folder, such as receiving new mail, which makes the MBOX file larger. 
- Deleting messages, or filtering or moving them to another folder, which does \*not\* immediately make the MBOX file smaller. The folder does not get smaller because, for performance reasons, a deleted message is only logically marked for deletion. It becomes a gap which you can longer access, and the gaps, like bits if dirt, are eventually removed (purged) with a compact operation.

**Note:** Compact does not apply to accounts using the [Maildir](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird"") storage format. Unlike MBOX, Maildir stores each message in a separate file, and deleting a message results in deleting the message file.

# When does compact occur?

A compact happens when:

- You right-click a folder and select Compact to compact a single folder
- You select File \> Compact Folders to compact all folders in an account
- The amount of disk space to be freed by removing the gaps exceeds the threshold for automatic compact ([configuration](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/compacting-folders#w_how-can-i-configure-compact) described below). Because deleting messages causes these gaps, you will often see the _Compact Folders_ prompt just after deleting a message.

# How can I configure compact?

≡ \> PreferencesPreferences (formerly Options) \> Network & Disk Space \> Disk Space

In the preferences, you can:

- Disable automatic compact (not recommended because your folders will not be regularly cleaned of deleted messages)
- Change the compact threshold - a higher value will result in less frequent compacts (for example, if you deal with large messages or a large volume of messages, then you may want use a larger threshold)
- Choose if you want to get prompted or if you prefer automatic compacting without prompts (new in Thunderbird 91). Note: The checkbox in the preferences and the corresponding checkbox in the prompt will have reverse values because they are worded differently.

![TB91-compact-folders-preferences-vs-prompt](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

# How does compact work?

Thunderbird opens the MBOX file on the disk (for example, the _Inbox_), and based on the rules for the MBOX mail format it reads the file one message at a time:

- If the message is still current, it is copied to a new temporary MBOX file, called Nstmp.
- If the message was marked as deleted or moved, that message is skipped and not moved to the mtemporary MBOX file.

This repeats until the end of the file is reached. Then the original storage file is deleted, the new one replaces it, and a new index for this message file is created (for example Inbox.msf). The end result is the gaps (the dirt) are gone.

During compact the progress is displayed in the Status Bar:

# Potential complications

Most users will experience no complications during or after the compact process. But because compact involves signficiant IO activity, some users might experience folder issues or slowness, even moreso if antivirus software monitoring is not excluding your [Thunderbird profile directory](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"").

<h1 id=""w_problems-with-composing-messages"">Problems with composing messages</h1>
<p>Unlike some other email programs, Thunderbird does not create a clickable link when you are composing a message and add a hyperlink. If you use the <span class=""menu"">Insert &gt; Link...</span> command, the link is formatted as a link (underlined and colored), but if you click it nothing happens. If you paste or type a link into the body of a message it appears in the text of the message without any indication that it is a link.  
</p><p>This behavior is deliberate. When links are ""activated"", they are difficult to edit (because when you try to position the cursor within an active link you usually launch the link in the browser). 
</p><p>When a message is sent (or saved as a draft), Thunderbird ""activates"" links in the message, adding formatting as necessary and making them clickable hyperlinks.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_problems-with-received-or-saved-mails"">Problems with received or saved mails</h1>
<p>When you click a hyperlink in a message, your system's default web browser should open (if it is not already running) and display the link. If that doesn't happen, there are several possible causes.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_check-that-the-operating-systems-default-browser-is-specified"">Check that the operating system's default browser is specified</h2>
<p>Every operating system allows the specification of a default browser that will be launched (for example) when a hyperlink in a message is clicked. Internet Explorer, Firefox, and other browsers check this setting by default when they start up and prompt you to set them as the default. Sometimes, however, this setting goes awry and your computer forgets which browser is the default. To fix this problem, you need to reset the default browser on your system.

# Problems with composing messages

Unlike some other email programs, Thunderbird does not create a clickable link when you are composing a message and add a hyperlink. If you use the Insert \> Link... command, the link is formatted as a link (underlined and colored), but if you click it nothing happens. If you paste or type a link into the body of a message it appears in the text of the message without any indication that it is a link.

This behavior is deliberate. When links are ""activated"", they are difficult to edit (because when you try to position the cursor within an active link you usually launch the link in the browser).

When a message is sent (or saved as a draft), Thunderbird ""activates"" links in the message, adding formatting as necessary and making them clickable hyperlinks.

# Problems with received or saved mails

When you click a hyperlink in a message, your system's default web browser should open (if it is not already running) and display the link. If that doesn't happen, there are several possible causes.

## Check that the operating system's default browser is specified

Every operating system allows the specification of a default browser that will be launched (for example) when a hyperlink in a message is clicked. Internet Explorer, Firefox, and other browsers check this setting by default when they start up and prompt you to set them as the default. Sometimes, however, this setting goes awry and your computer forgets which browser is the default. To fix this problem, you need to reset the default browser on your system.

### Firefox

See [Make Firefox your default browser](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/make-firefox-your-default-browser"") for instructions. Then restart Thunderbird.

### Internet Explorer

See Microsoft's article [Make Internet Explorer your default browser](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17435/windows-internet-explorer-make-default-browser) for instructions. Then restart Thunderbird.

### Edge

See Microsoft's article [Make Microsoft Edge your default browser](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/5b81713b-5ab4-4462-a002-93e8d3d34c06/make-microsoft-edge-your-default-browser). Then restart Thunderbird.

## Check that no application is specified for the HTTP content type

In Thunderbird, you can specify an action that occurs when you click on various types of attachments and inline content. If the action for the HTTP / HTTPS content type is set incorrectly, this will prevent links from opening correctly.

If the operating system's default browser is specified correctly as described above, it is not necessary to specify an action for the HTTP / HTTPS content type. To check this setting, select ![Fx57Menu](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) \> Preferences and search the preferences dialog for ""content"" and then work with the list of file types under the Content type column. If HTTP and/or HTTPS are listed in the Content Type column, either delete the action or ensure the specified action is correct. This situation can arise by receiving a link of HTTP or HTTPS type as an attachment to an email and when asked what to do with the attachment you specify to do this next time.

## Check for an incorrect preference

In some circumstances, a normally hidden preference gets changed, resulting in Thunderbird trying to handle these links internally. One of these circumstances appears to be after you uninstall the ThunderBrowse add-on, although the upgrade process to V5 appears to have caused it for some people as well. To check if this might be the cause, open the Troubleshooting Information in the Help menu and under the Important Modified Preferences heading, look for a preference called network.protocol-handler.external-default or any other preference beginning with _network.protocol-handler.warn-external_. If any of these are present and set to _false_, then this is your problem.

To correct this setting, use the [Config Editor](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/config-editor"") to change the hidden preferences from _false_ to _true_. Type _network.protocol-handler.external-default_ into the field, or at least so much of it that the entry appears in the list below. Select the entry in the list, right-click it and select the Reset option from the menu that appears.

## Check for interference from an extension

It is time to look for an extension that may be causing some unwanted behavior. Run Thunderbird in [Thunderbird Safe Mode](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-mode-thunderbird""). If you can click on hyperlinks in Thunderbird Safe Mode but not in normal mode, your problem is probably being caused by an add-on (also known as an extension).

Next, try the [Standard Diagnostics](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Standard_diagnostic_-_Thunderbird).

If you still have a problem, go [here](https://support.mozilla.org/questions/new/thunderbird) and ask about what could be the cause. Before you post your question, be sure to say exactly what you have done already to diagnose the problem.

# What does the Primary Password protect?

**Your primary password protects your saved passwords, but it _does not_ prevent others from seeing your messages in Thunderbird.**

Thunderbird can save passwords for each account, so you don't have to re-enter them when you check for new messages. You can view them and remove the ones you don't use anymore.

What if you share a computer, and don't want others to see your stored passwords? With the Primary Password feature, Thunderbird will require you to enter a Primary Password in order to view or use the passwords you've told Thunderbird to remember. When you have a Primary Password set, you'll only need to enter it once per session.

**Do you want to prevent others from seeing your messages?** If you are sharing a computer, the most secure way is to create a separate WindowsmacOSOS user account on the operating system for each person, and make sure your WindowsmacOSOS account requires a password. Thunderbird stores accounts, messages and password information separately for each operating system account.

# Set a Primary Password

By default, Thunderbird does not use a Primary Password to protect stored credentials. To set a Primary Password:

1. In the menu bar, click the Thunderbird menu and select Settings.Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and choose Settings.

  - Make your Primary Password something that is easy for you to remember, but difficult for others to guess, to ensure that only _you yourself_ will be able to see your saved passwords.
6. The password must be entered twice to make sure that you have entered it correctly as intended.  
  
 ![tb91-use-primary-password-primary-password-dialog](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

# Creating a new event

Creating an event is easy. Simply do one of the following things:

- Click the File menu at the top of the Thunderbird window, or click the menu button ![New Fx Menu](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)The image ""fx57menu"" does not exist..

In both _Calendar Mode_ and _Event Mode_ you can use the above methods but you can also use the dedicated New Event button in the ""Calendar Toolbar"":

![6d93cae9f31ae015f44f449d934ff422-1298311966-428-2.png](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)  
In this window you can set the details of the event. Here's a description of all the possible values:

- Title: The name of the event. This is what you will see when you first glance at the calendar
- Location: Where the event will be taking place
- Category: What type of event is it?
- Calendar: Which calendar would you like to store the event in (see Creating new calendars)
- Start and End: Choose the time the event begins, and the time that it ends
- Repeat: If this event will happen again, check this box (see [Creating a recurring event](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/creating-a-recurring-event""))
- Reminder: Will pop up with an alarm at a specified time before the event.
- Description: A brief summary/list of the event

By default event are assumed to have a start and end date and time.

You can set these dates and times by entering them via the keyboard in the respective field or by clicking on the drop-down arrow in that same field. You will then be presented with the following selection options:

![6d93cae9f31ae015f44f449d934ff422-1298311966-428-4.png](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

**When changing the start date, the end date will automatically be set to the same date.**

![6d93cae9f31ae015f44f449d934ff422-1298311966-428-5.png](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

You select a time by first selecting the hours and then the minutes. The window will close automatically after selecting the minutes.

If you want to use a time that is not shown, you can extend the selections by clicking on the \>\> button at the bottom right.

![6d93cae9f31ae015f44f449d934ff422-1298311966-428-6.png](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

If the event does not have a start or end time you can select the All day event tick-box after which the start and end time will be greyed out.

![6d93cae9f31ae015f44f449d934ff422-1298311966-428-7.png](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

After setting up your existing email address with convenient auto-configuration, Thunderbird will now automatically detect your remote address books and calendars based on the user information you provided.

When adding a Google mail account to Thunderbird, you can easily add your existing Google calendars and address book (see [Notes](https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/beta/T9886a223d58b7aad-M09757bc2dee271bf7d29580b)).

**Note:** If one of your Google calendars is not found or not accessible, it might not be set up for syncing. You can choose which calendars Google will expose in your [Google Calendar Sync Settings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/syncselect). Unfortunately, Google does not support tasks through CalDAV.

# Creating a new calendar

- Right-clickHold down the control key while you click in the calendar list on the left side of the screen.
- Choose New Calendar… from the context menu.
- Alternatively, you can use ≡ \> New \> Calendar…, or File \> New \> Calendar….

Now you need to choose whether you want to create the calendar ""on your computer"" or ""on the network"".

## On your computer - local calendars

When choosing ""On my computer"", you can only use the calendar on the computer you're working at. All the data is stored inside an internal database (the file local.sqlite in your Thunderbird profile).

- Choose **On my computer** and click NextContinue.
- Enter a name for your calendar and choose a color, then click Create Calendar.

## On the Network - connect to your online calendars

When choosing ""On the Network"", your calendar files may reside on general webservers (read-only), on WebDAV or CalDAV servers, on the local filesystem or a network share, or you could use your Google calendars.

- Choose **On the Network** and click NextContinue.

When you first install Thunderbird it creates a profile called ""default"", and this profile is used automatically. However, you can create additional profiles, each with their own set of account configurations, messages, etc. (Note, each profile can access multiple email accounts.)

The Profile Manager is used to create and delete profiles, and to select the profile to use for a Thunderbird session.

- **Server Type** : This setting is determined at the time the account is created. 

- **Server Name** and **Port** : This is the server Thunderbird will connect to when retrieving messages for your account. The name and port number are provided by your mail provider. 

- **User Name** : When contacting the server for new messages, the user name identifies which account you are retrieving messages for. Your user name is provided by your mail provider.

## Security Settings

- **Connection Security** : These settings determine if your connection to the server is encrypted.
  - **None** : The connection is not encrypted.
  - **SSL/TLS** : (Recommended when possible) The connection is encrypted.
  - **STARTTLS** : The connection starts as unencrypted, but attempts to make a secure connection if the server supports it.

- **Authentication method** : These are various methods used to verify that you are the owner of the account you are trying to access. Your account provider will determine which authentication to choose. 

## Server Settings

- **Check for new messages at startup** : With this setting enabled, Thunderbird will check the account for new messages when you start Thunderbird.

- **Check for new messages every \_\_ minutes** : Make Thunderbird check for new messages automatically on a set time interval. 

- **Allow immediate server notifications when new messages arrive** : (IMAP accounts only) With this setting, Thunderbird will use the IMAP IDLE command, allowing you to receive new messages as soon as they arrive on the server without having to check the server for new messages.

_When I delete a message:_ (IMAP accounts only) By default, when you delete a message, Thunderbird will move it to the Trash folder for that account. Here, you can change that behavior.

- **Move it to this folder** : Instead of moving the message to the trash folder, use this menu to select a different folder where messages will be moved to.
- **Just mark it as deleted** : Using this setting will keep the deleted message in the original folder, but strike a line through it to show you it has been marked as deleted. To clear the folder of deleted messages, right-click on the folder and select Compact.
- **Remove it immediately** : Choose this setting to make Thunderbird remove messages when you delete them, without moving them to any folder.

- **Automatically download new messages** : (POP accounts only) If Thunderbird checks for new messages using the _Check for new messages every_ setting and detects new messages, you will still need to click Get Messages to download those new messages. Enable this setting to automatically download those new messages when they are detected.

- **Fetch headers only** : (POP accounts only) With this setting enabled, Thunderbird will only download the message headers. When you want to view a new message, Thunderbird will present a link to download the message content.

- **Leave messages on server** : (POP accounts only) Using this setting, Thunderbird will not remove messages from the server after you've downloaded them. Set _For at most \_\_ days_ to delete messages from the server after a set time period. Set _Until I delete them_ to delete messages from the server when you delete them from Thunderbird.

## Message Storage

- **Clean up (""Expunge"") Inbox on Exit**: (IMAP accounts only) When a message is deleted, the master copy on the server is only marked as deleted. Enable this setting to remove messages on the server inbox marked as deleted from the server.

- **Empty Trash on Exit** : With this setting enabled, Thunderbird will empty your trash folder when you exit the program/application.

- **Message Store Type** : This setting determines if Thunderbird stores mail folders locally in single files (For example, there's a file called _Inbox_) or stores each message in its own file. For more information, see [Maildir in Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird"").
**NOTE:** This setting is determined when creating an account.

- **Local Directory** : This is the location where Thunderbird stores messages for the account. If you'd like to store messages for the account in a separate location from the rest of your Thunderbird profile, click Browse to select the directory you want.

Disable this setting to make Thunderbird display all folders on the server. To select which folders you see, right-click on the account in the folder pane, and select Subscribe.

- **Server supports folders that contain sub-folders and messages** : Use this setting if your server folders residing in other folders.

- **Maximum number of server connections to cache** : Most servers support multiple connections. If you have an issue with connections to the server being dropped, try lowering this number.

- Namespaces are used when your account has shared folders. For instance, your inbox is accessible only to you, but there may be a folder shared with other users. **Personal namespace** determines the directory are that is only accessible to you. **Public (shared)** determines which directory is accessible to anyone. Use **Other Users** to determine specific users.

- **Allow server to override these namespaces** : Enable this setting to let the server determine your namespaces.

## Advanced POP Settings

(POP accounts only) Click on Advanced to configure your Inbox storage.

- **When downloading mail from this account's server, use the following folder to store new messages** : The setting determines which folder to use as the inbox for this account. By pointing more than one account to the same inbox, you can have one Inbox for all of your POP accounts.

1. In the menu bar, click the Thunderbird menu and select Settings.Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and choose Settings.
2. Select the Advanced panel.
3. Select the Update tab.
4. Uncheck the **Thunderbird** and **Installed Add-ons** options.Check **Never check for updates (not recommended: security risk)**.

# Home page loading

By default, Thunderbird automatically loads a page with the latest Thunderbird information when the application is started. This page is downloaded from the Internet. To prevent Thunderbird from loading this page:

1. In the menu bar, click the Thunderbird menu and select Settings.Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and choose Settings.
2. Select the General panel.
3. Uncheck the **When Thunderbird launches, show the Start Page in the message area** option.

# Add-on list prefetching

Each time the Add-ons tab is opened, Thunderbird prefetches a list of add-ons to improve responsiveness of the **Get Add-ons** pane. This connection is only made when the Add-ons Manager is opened.

# Extension blocklist updating

**Warning** : Disabling blocklist updating is not recommended and may result in you using extensions known to be untrustworthy.

Mozilla maintains a list of extensions that are not approved for use with Thunderbird. Thunderbird downloads this list from the Internet. To disable this:

1. In the menu bar, click the Thunderbird menu and select Settings.Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and choose Settings.
2. Select the Advanced panel.
3. Select the General tab.
4. Click Config Editor….
5. Enter extensions.blocklist.enabled in the **Search** field.
6. Observe the **Value** column of the extensions.blocklist.enabled row.
  - If it is set to false, then do nothing.
  - If it is set to true, double-click on it to set it to false.

# Extensions

Installed and activated extensions may connect to the Internet. For example, a translation extension might connect to the Internet to look up words in a dictionary. See the [Add-ons and Extensions FAQ](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new?title=Add-ons+and+Extensions+FAQ#w_how-do-i-disable-or-uninstall-an-add-on"" ""Page does not exist."") for information about disabling add-ons.

17139,How can I send a large attachment?,how-can-i-send-large-attachment,https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-can-i-send-large-attachment,en-US,This article explains how to use Thunderbird (or other services) to send large attachments.,"<p>Sometimes you need to send a large amount of data as a message attachment (for example, a collection of high resolution photos, or a project on which you are working). Mail servers (both yours and the message recipient) usually have a restriction of the size of attachments that they will allow. The maximum allowable size varies from server to server, according to their individual configuration. For example, Comcast's maximum size for binary attachments is around 10.9 MB, while Gmail allows attachments up to 25 MB.
</p><p>If you exceed the server limit, you will get an error message like this:
</p>
<div class=""warning"">The size of the message you are trying to send exceeds the global size limit (XX XXX XXX bytes) of the server. The message was not sent, try to reduce the message size and try again.</div> where XX XXX XXX is the maximum file size that you can send.
<p>In addition to server restrictions, however, you must also consider how long it takes for the message to be uploaded from your computer to the server and then downloaded from the server to the message recipient. A message with a large attachment will take a long time to upload and download and may block other operations while it is being handled.
</p><p>In general, it is best to minimize the size of your attachment(s). If that is not possible, you can upload attachments to an external storage service rather than attaching them to messages.

<h1 id=""w_accounts"">Accounts</h1>
<h2 id=""w_mail-accounts"">Mail Accounts</h2>
<p>This article explains the types of protocols (IMAP, POP, RSS, NNTP) supported by Thunderbird. See <a href=""/en-US/kb/automatic-account-configuration"">Automatic Account Configuration</a> or <a href=""/en-US/kb/manual-account-configuration"">Manual Account Configuration</a> for information about how to configure accounts in Thunderbird.
</p><p>A ""protocol"" is a set of rules that computing devices use to communicate. Common protocols include HTTP (for transmitting web pages) and FTP (for sending files).
</p><p>Email communications use several protocols to send and receive messages. When sending messages, email programs use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smtp"">SMTP</a> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). To fetch messages, email programs use either <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol"">POP</a> (Post Office Protocol) or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol"">IMAP</a> (Internet Message Access Protocol). 
</p><p>The differences between the POP and IMAP protocols are described below. As of Thunderbird version 3, IMAP has been the default protocol for fetching messages (although you can manually configure an account to use the POP protocol). In most cases, your choice of protocol will be dictated by your mail account provider.
</p>
<h3 id=""w_imap"">IMAP</h3>
<p>When an email program uses the IMAP protocol, messages are stored both on the mail server and on the local device where the email program is running. Changes are synchronized between the client and the server. Therefore, if you access your account from more than one device, you see the same set of messages, message status and folder structure regardless of the device you are using (because all the email programs synchronize with the server).
</p><p>The main drawback of IMAP is that it tends to send and receive more traffic between the device and the mail server, so performance can be poor if your Internet connection is slow or costly if you are paying expensive rates for data use (for example, on a per-megabyte basis).
</p><p>Accounts that use the IMAP protocol may confuse people if they are not aware of the synchronization aspect. A person might think that deleting a message on one device only deleted the local copy, not realizing that the message is also deleted from the server and therefore from all other devices that access that account. 
</p><p>A detailed discussion of configuring and using the IMAP can be found <a href=""/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization"">here</a>.
</p>
<h3 id=""w_pop"">POP</h3>
<p>The POP mail protocol is very simple. There is no synchronization. POP connects to the server, downloads the contents of the inbox to your device and then logs out from the server. POP can leave messages on the server. The default for Thunderbird is to leave them there for 7 days. The retention period can be edited from your <a class=""new"" href=""/en-US/kb/new?title=Manual+Account+Configuration+"" title=""Page does not exist.""> account settings</a>.
</p><p>The advantage of POP is that it is simple, requires significantly less data to be transmitted between the server and you, and once the mail is in your inbox, it is not tied to a server or another device.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_rss"">RSS</h2>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS"">RSS</a> (commonly known as Really Simple Syndication) is a protocol that communicates changes on a website. For example, when a blogger writes a new blog post, that post is added to the site's RSS feed. Using an RSS feed reader (such as Thunderbird), you can read the new activity on blogs to which you have subscribed. 
</p>
<h2 id=""w_news"">News</h2>
<p>News servers are one of the oldest forms of collaborative communication on the Internet. They are like a mailing list, in that you post a message and the message is propagated to anyone else that has subscribed to that newsgroup. Unlike a true mailing list server, you don't have to subscribe to the list in order to see the messages. You simply connect to the news server and view postings to the newsgroup.
</p><p>The only time your membership of the group is shown publicly is when you actually post a message to the newsgroup. Newsgroups also differ from mailing lists in that you don't have to use your real email address to post. You can post with an anonymous or invalid address such as None@nowhere.com. Unlike mailing lists, you don't download new messages to your inbox. Instead you are simply notified of unread posts in the newsgroup. Messages are not downloaded unless you elect to click on them. Only the list of messages arrives when you select the group.
</p><p>Much communication at Mozilla is done through newsgroups and duplicated through mailing lists and web pages.
</p><p>See <a href=""/en-US/kb/creating-newsgroup-account"">Creating a Newsgroup Account</a> for configuration instructions.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_profile-profile-folder"">Profile / Profile Folder</h1>
<p>Thunderbird stores all user data, including settings in a location on your computer referred to as the profile folder.
</p><p>For detailed information, see <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"">Profiles</a> and <a href=""/en-US/kb/using-multiple-profiles"">Using Multiple Profiles</a>.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_time"">Time</h1>
<p>The time used by email is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"">Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</a> to make the user experience of email acceptable, the raw UTC time is not displayed by email programs. They convert the UTC time to local time using the timezone information on the computer, including daylight savings time.

# Accounts

## Mail Accounts

This article explains the types of protocols (IMAP, POP, RSS, NNTP) supported by Thunderbird. See [Automatic Account Configuration](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-account-configuration"") or [Manual Account Configuration](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manual-account-configuration"") for information about how to configure accounts in Thunderbird.

A ""protocol"" is a set of rules that computing devices use to communicate. Common protocols include HTTP (for transmitting web pages) and FTP (for sending files).

Email communications use several protocols to send and receive messages. When sending messages, email programs use [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smtp) (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). To fetch messages, email programs use either [POP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol) (Post Office Protocol) or [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol) (Internet Message Access Protocol).

The differences between the POP and IMAP protocols are described below. As of Thunderbird version 3, IMAP has been the default protocol for fetching messages (although you can manually configure an account to use the POP protocol). In most cases, your choice of protocol will be dictated by your mail account provider.

### IMAP

When an email program uses the IMAP protocol, messages are stored both on the mail server and on the local device where the email program is running. Changes are synchronized between the client and the server. Therefore, if you access your account from more than one device, you see the same set of messages, message status and folder structure regardless of the device you are using (because all the email programs synchronize with the server).

The main drawback of IMAP is that it tends to send and receive more traffic between the device and the mail server, so performance can be poor if your Internet connection is slow or costly if you are paying expensive rates for data use (for example, on a per-megabyte basis).

Accounts that use the IMAP protocol may confuse people if they are not aware of the synchronization aspect. A person might think that deleting a message on one device only deleted the local copy, not realizing that the message is also deleted from the server and therefore from all other devices that access that account.

A detailed discussion of configuring and using the IMAP can be found [here](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization"").

### POP

The POP mail protocol is very simple. There is no synchronization. POP connects to the server, downloads the contents of the inbox to your device and then logs out from the server. POP can leave messages on the server. The default for Thunderbird is to leave them there for 7 days. The retention period can be edited from your [account settings](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new?title=Manual+Account+Configuration+"" ""Page does not exist."").

The advantage of POP is that it is simple, requires significantly less data to be transmitted between the server and you, and once the mail is in your inbox, it is not tied to a server or another device.

## RSS

[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) (commonly known as Really Simple Syndication) is a protocol that communicates changes on a website. For example, when a blogger writes a new blog post, that post is added to the site's RSS feed. Using an RSS feed reader (such as Thunderbird), you can read the new activity on blogs to which you have subscribed.

## News

News servers are one of the oldest forms of collaborative communication on the Internet. They are like a mailing list, in that you post a message and the message is propagated to anyone else that has subscribed to that newsgroup. Unlike a true mailing list server, you don't have to subscribe to the list in order to see the messages. You simply connect to the news server and view postings to the newsgroup.

The only time your membership of the group is shown publicly is when you actually post a message to the newsgroup. Newsgroups also differ from mailing lists in that you don't have to use your real email address to post. You can post with an anonymous or invalid address such as None@nowhere.com. Unlike mailing lists, you don't download new messages to your inbox. Instead you are simply notified of unread posts in the newsgroup. Messages are not downloaded unless you elect to click on them. Only the list of messages arrives when you select the group.

Much communication at Mozilla is done through newsgroups and duplicated through mailing lists and web pages.

See [Creating a Newsgroup Account](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/creating-newsgroup-account"") for configuration instructions.

# Profile / Profile Folder

Thunderbird stores all user data, including settings in a location on your computer referred to as the profile folder.

For detailed information, see [Profiles](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"") and [Using Multiple Profiles](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/using-multiple-profiles"").

# Time

The time used by email is [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) to make the user experience of email acceptable, the raw UTC time is not displayed by email programs. They convert the UTC time to local time using the timezone information on the computer, including daylight savings time. This can at times lead to confusion, particularly when you get a reply that shows a time different to the one your sent items shows.

# Return Receipts

Almost all email programs can offer to request a return receipt from the recipient, some call it a read receipt. Thunderbird is no exception. With default settings in Thunderbird, you will be prompted/asked if you want to return a read receipt when you first select a message that has this flag set to read it. It is then up to you if you want to notify the sender you read their mail.

# Delivery Status Notifications

These come in two kinds, positive and negative responses.

The negative response is when you get an email that says something like _Sorry, your message could not be delivered to:..._ followed by a reason why the message could not be delivered. These messages are reasonably common, although many servers have stopped sending them due to [Backscatter from SPAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_%28email%29).

The positive delivery status notification is also becoming far less popular. Most email servers have this option turned off as the delivery confirmation validates the address on a spammers mailing list, and this presents something of a privacy concern. Did the account owner authorize the mail provider to confirm their email address?

# Outbox

## Where is the 'Outbox'?

The 'Outbox', located under 'Local folders', is a waiting area for emails that have not been sent.

## How do I use the 'Outbox'?

If you have written an email, but do not want to send the email immediately and you are working with Thunderbird 'online', then you can choose 'File' \> 'Send Later' to send the email to the 'Outbox' to wait until you want to send it.

If you write an email and are working 'offline', either because you are not connected to the Internet or you have selected Thunderbird to work 'offline', then you will only see a 'Send Later' option and your email will be sent to the 'Outbox'.

# What does Thunderbird 'offline' mean?

You can tell Thunderbird to work 'online' or 'offline' (the latter not being able to connect to the server). If you see two blue screen icons in the bottom status bar on the far left, this indicates that Thunderbird is 'online'. Two black screen icons in the bottom status bar on the far left will indicate that Thunderbird is 'offline'.

You can set Thunderbird to work 'offline' by selecting File \> Offline \> Work Offline. This setting works whether you are using POP or IMAP.

# Overview

Thunderbird's adaptive filter uses a Bayes algorithm plus training data you have collected to determine which messages it will automatically set as junk. But using an algorithm means a message previously marked as junk is not guaranteed to be automatically marked as junk in the future. If you want a guarantee, see [Create filters manually](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#w_create-filters-manually).

To guarantee that important messages will NOT be marked as junk, use [Whitelisting](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#w_whitelisting).

Also, because junk mail constantly changes, it is recommended that you regularly train Thunderbird. If you do not train frequently, then Thunderbird will not provide good results.

# Junk filter settings

## Global junk settings

Junk filtering is enabled by default. And you can set global junk settings to tune what should happen to messages marked as junk. These settings will be used for all email accounts (although some settings can be overridden in the [Per account settings](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#w_per-account-settings), as shown below).

1. Click ≡ \> Settings \> Privacy & Security

### How to turn off Thunderbird's adaptive filtering

- Un-tick _Enable adaptive junk mail controls for this account_

### Whitelisting

Under _Do not automatically mark mail as junk if the sender is in_ you can select address books which will be used as a whitelist. Senders whose email address is in a whitelisted address book are exempt and will not be automatically marked as junk by Thunderbird. But you can still manually marking a message containing a whitelisted address as junk.

**It is recommended that you enable whitelisting to help ensure that messages from people you most care about will not be marked as junk.**

# Training the junk filter

In order for Thunderbird's junk filter to be effective, you must train it to recognize messages that you consider to be junk **and** messages that you consider to be **not** junk. If you do not do both, then the filter will not be very effective.

Note also, it is important to mark messages as junk before deleting them. Just deleting a message doesn't train the filter.

## Tell Thunderbird what is JUNK

There are several ways of marking messages as junk:

- Or you can press J on your keyboard to mark one or more selected messages as junk.

Once you mark a message as junk, if you have configured your [Global junk settings](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#w_global-junk-settings) or [Per account settings](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#w_per-account-settings) to move junk email to a different folder, the email will disappear from the [Message List Pane](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/getting-started-thunderbird-main-window-supernova#w_7-message-list-pane"") for the current folder. Don't worry, the email has moved to the folder you have configured for junk mail.

Thunderbird's junk filter has been designed to learn from the training data which you provide. Marking more messages as **Junk** or **Not Junk** (see below) will improve the accuracy of your junk filter by adding more training data.

## Tell Thunderbird what is NOT JUNK

Sometimes Thunderbird's junk filter might get it wrong and mark _good_ messages as junk. Therefore, it is just as important to tell the filter which messages are _not_ junk, especially on a new installation of Thunderbird.

**Note:** You should frequently (daily or weekly) check your Junk folder for _good_ messages wrongly marked as Junk by Thunderbird and mark them as **Not Junk**. This will recover the good messages and improve the correctness of the filter for the future.

There are several ways of marking messages as **Not Junk**.

- Click on the Not Junk button in the yellow junk notification below the message header in the [Message List Pane](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/getting-started-thunderbird-main-window-supernova#w_7-message-list-pane""):<dl><dt>

</dt></dl>
- Click on the red junk icon in the **Junk** column of the [Message List Pane](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/getting-started-thunderbird-main-window-supernova#w_7-message-list-pane"") to toggle the junk status of a message:<dl><dt>
<img alt=""TB115-thread-pane-unmark-junk-column"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2024-03-20-19-10-56-026297.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" width=""300"">
</dt></dl>
- Or press Shift+J on your keyboard to mark one or more messages as **Not Junk**.

Once you un-mark a message as junk, the email will disappear from the current folder. Don't worry the email is still there! It will be in its original folder; the folder it was in before it was marked as junk.

## Repeated training

You should **regularly** train the filter by marking a number of **good** messages as not junk - messages in your Inbox _and_ messages that have been filtered into other folders. In this case, you can only use the keyboard shortcut Shift+J, because the Not Junk button appears only for messages that have already been marked as junk. Marking several messages per week will be sufficient, and you can select many messages and mark all of them at the same time.

Unfortunately the user interface does not help you see whether a message has already been marked as ""not junk"".

# Other ways of blocking unwanted messages

Thunderbird's adaptive junk filter is not an absolute barrier against messages from a specific address or specific types of messages. You can have stronger mechanisms to stop unwanted messages by using the following methods.

## Create filters manually

You can manually:

- [Block some senders](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/blocking-sender"").
- [Create filters](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/organize-your-messages-using-filters#w_create-a-new-filter"") to block messages based on subject or other criteria.

## Use an external filter service

You can also use an external filter service to help classify email and block junk.

1. Click ≡ \> Account Settings \> **Your Account** \> Junk Settings
2. Enable the Trust junk mail headers set by option.
3. Choose an external filter service in the drop-down menu.<dl><dt>

<p>This tutorial explains how to set up Thunderbird to digitally sign, encrypt and decrypt messages in order to make them secure.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_introduction"">Introduction</h1>
<p>The email infrastructure that everyone uses is, by design, not secure. While most people connect to their email servers using a secure (""SSL"") connection, some servers allow unsecured access. Furthermore, as the message moves through its transmission path from sender to recipient, the connections between each server are not necessarily secure. It is possible for third parties to intercept, read and alter email messages as they are transmitted.
</p><p>When you <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature"">digitally sign</a> a message, you embed information in the message that validates your identity. When you encrypt a message, it appears to be ""scrambled"" and can only by read by a person who has the key to decrypting the message. Digitally signing a message ensures that the message originated from the stated sender. Encrypting ensures that the message has not been read or altered during transmission.
</p><p>To encrypt messages, you can use the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"">public-key cryptographic system</a>. In this system, each participant has two separate keys: <strong>a public encryption key</strong> and <strong>a private decryption key</strong>. When someone wants send you an encrypted message, he or she uses your public key to generate the encryption algorithm. When you receive the message, you must use your private key to decrypt it.
</p>
<div class=""note""> Note: Never share your private key with anyone. </div>
<p>The protocol used to encrypt emails is called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"">PGP</a> (Pretty Good Privacy). To use PGP within Thunderbird, you must first install:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href=""http://www.gnupg.org/"">GnuPG</a>: (GNU Privacy Guard): a free software implementation of PGP
</li><li> <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/"">Enigmail</a>: a Thunderbird add-on
</li></ul>
<p>These two applications also provide the capability to digitally sign messages.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_installing-gpg-and-enigmail"">Installing GPG and Enigmail</h1>
<p>To install GnuPG, download appropriate package from the <a href=""http://www.gnupg.org/download/index.en.html#auto-ref-3"">GnuPG binaries page</a>. Follow the installation instructions provided for your particular package. For more information on installing PGP on specific operating systems, refer to:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href=""http://write.flossmanuals.net/thunderbird-workbook/installing-pgp-in-windows/"">Installing PGP on Windows</a>

</li><li> <a href=""http://write.flossmanuals.net/thunderbird-workbook/installing-pgp-in-osx/"">Installing PGP on Mac OS X</a>
</li></ul>
<p>To install Enigmail:
</p>
<ol><li> In Thunderbird, select <span class=""menu"">Tools &gt; Add-ons</span>.
</li><li> Use the search bar in the top right corner to search for Enigmail.
</li><li> Select Enigmail from the search results and follow the instructions to install the add-on.
</li></ol>
<h1 id=""w_creating-pgp-keys"">Creating PGP keys</h1>
<p>Create your public/private keys as follows:
</p>
<ol><li> On the Thunderbird menu bar, click <span class=""menu"">OpenPGP</span> and select <span class=""menu"">Setup Wizard</span>. 	
</li><li> Select <span class=""pref"">Yes, I would like the wizard to get me started</span> as shown in the image below. Click <span class=""button"">Next</span> to proceed.

</dt></dl>
</li><li> The wizard asks whether you want to sign all outgoing messages or whether you want to configure different rules for different recipients. It is usually a good idea to sign all emails so that people can confirm that the email is indeed from you. Message recipients do not need to use digital signatures or PGP to read a digitally signed message. Select <span class=""pref"">Yes, I want to sign all of my email</span> and click <span class=""button"">Next</span> to proceed.
</li><li> Next, the wizard asks if you want to encrypt all your emails. You should not select this option unless you have the public keys for all the people that you expect to send messages to. Select <span class=""pref"">No, I will create per-recipient rules for those who send me their public keys</span> and click <span class=""button"">Next</span> to proceed.
</li><li> The wizard asks if it can change some of your mail formatting settings to better work with PGP. It is a good choice to answer <span class=""pref"">Yes</span> here. Click <span class=""button"">Next</span> to proceed.
</li><li> Select the email account for which you want to create the keys. You need to enter a password in the ‘Passphrase’ text box which is used to protect your private key. This password is used to decrypt messages, so don't forget it. The password should be at least 8 characters long and not use any dictionary words. (See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Guidelines_for_strong_passwords"">this Wikipedia article</a> for information on creating strong passwords.) Enter this password twice and click <span class=""button"">Next</span> to proceed.
</li><li> The next screen displays the preferences you configured. If you are satisfied, click <span class=""button"">Next</span> to proceed.
</li><li> When the process of creating your keys is completed, click <span class=""button"">Next</span> to proceed.
</li><li> The wizard will ask if you want to create a ‘Revocation certificate’ which you would use if the security of your key pair was compromised and you needed to inform others that it is no longer valid. If you want to create the file click on <span class=""button"">Generate Certificate</span> and follow the steps on the subsequent screens. Otherwise, click <span class=""button"">Skip</span>.
</li><li> The wizard finally informs you that it has completed the process. Click <span class=""button"">Finish</span> to exit the wizard.

This tutorial explains how to set up Thunderbird to digitally sign, encrypt and decrypt messages in order to make them secure.

# Introduction

The email infrastructure that everyone uses is, by design, not secure. While most people connect to their email servers using a secure (""SSL"") connection, some servers allow unsecured access. Furthermore, as the message moves through its transmission path from sender to recipient, the connections between each server are not necessarily secure. It is possible for third parties to intercept, read and alter email messages as they are transmitted.

When you [digitally sign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) a message, you embed information in the message that validates your identity. When you encrypt a message, it appears to be ""scrambled"" and can only by read by a person who has the key to decrypting the message. Digitally signing a message ensures that the message originated from the stated sender. Encrypting ensures that the message has not been read or altered during transmission.

To encrypt messages, you can use the [public-key cryptographic system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). In this system, each participant has two separate keys: **a public encryption key** and **a private decryption key**. When someone wants send you an encrypted message, he or she uses your public key to generate the encryption algorithm. When you receive the message, you must use your private key to decrypt it.

 Note: Never share your private key with anyone. 

The protocol used to encrypt emails is called [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) (Pretty Good Privacy). To use PGP within Thunderbird, you must first install:

- [GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org/): (GNU Privacy Guard): a free software implementation of PGP
- [Enigmail](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/): a Thunderbird add-on

These two applications also provide the capability to digitally sign messages.

# Installing GPG and Enigmail

To install GnuPG, download appropriate package from the [GnuPG binaries page](http://www.gnupg.org/download/index.en.html#auto-ref-3). Follow the installation instructions provided for your particular package. For more information on installing PGP on specific operating systems, refer to:

4. A dialog box appears asking if you really want to revoke the key. Click Revoke Key to proceed.
5. Another dialog box appears asking you to enter your secret passphrase. Enter the passphrase and click OK to revoke the key.

Send the revocation certificate to the people you correspond with so that they know that your current key is no longer valid. This ensures that if someone tries to use your current key to impersonate you, the recipients will know that the key pair is not valid.

# Introduction

## Why would I need my own email address?

- Want a mail address that belongs to you or your family or your organization?
- Don't like the idea that your personal messages are owned by some big world wide company?
- Want to be free to change your Internet Service Provider without worrying if your mail address will survive?
- Don't want a robot to scan your messages in order to detect which ad is better for you to see when you use webmail, or maybe you don't want ads at the end of your messages?

In order to answer these questions and to provide a great email experience to its users, Thunderbird allows you to subscribe to some email services that can give you a personal email address. Instead of using something like john.smith@gmail.com, you can use for instance john@smith.us, or john.smith@mylittlecompagnie.com

## What does Thunderbird provide&nbsp;?

Thunderbird is currently working with two major email service providers:

- [Mailfence](https://mailfence.com/) (based in Europe)
- [Gandi](http://www.gandi.net/) (based in Europe)

Usually email address providers will charge you an annual fee to set-up and host your personalized account. Depending on the email address provider, the personalized email account can come with other services. We encourage you to examine each mail provider's offering and pick the one that's best for you. Here's a quick glance at the paid offers (free offers may differ):

| | **Mailfence** | **Gandi** |
| Custom email domain | yes | yes |
| Email alias addresses | 10 | Unlimited |
| Mailbox size | 5 GB - 50 GB | (2x) 3 GB - 50 GB |
| Cloud storage | 12 GB - 70 GB | n/a |

Note that both of them support POP and IMAP, secure connections, and some other features. If you have special needs (larger mailbox capacity, more address for you or your business) then you can simply upgrade to another email package at the same provider.

# How do I set up a new mail account?

## Creating a new email account

When you start Thunderbird for the first time, or select File \> New \> Get a New Mail Account, you are given the option to acquire an entirely new email account from an email service provider. Enter the name you want to use for your new email address in the field at the top, select the desired provider and click Search.

The email service provider(s) you selected will show you available email addresses that are based on the name you entered. You can change the name you entered and search again until you find the email address you like best. If the email service provider charges for an account, the amount will be displayed.

![TB78-Get-a-new-mail-account-Sample-search](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

Select the address you would like to acquire by clicking on the button that displays the amount. You will be prompted to create an account on the email service provider's site and configure payment and other options.

After creating your new account, Thunderbird will automatically configure it so you can begin using the new account right away.

## Configuring an existing email account

If you already have a _Mailfence_ or a _Gandi_ account (or any other type of accounts), you can skip the process of creating a new account and move on to configuring an existing account, by clicking on Skip this and use my existing email. These pages provide more details about the setup of an existing email address in Thunderbird:

- [Automatic Account Configuration](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-account-configuration"") in Thunderbird (for any other email address) 

To abort the account configuration process, click I think I'll configure my account later.

# Using the new email account

Your new email account will be displayed in the Folder panel on the left side of the main Thunderbird window.

Messages will be automatically downloaded to the new account when Thunderbird checks the server for messages.

You can now customize your mail account, for instance by composing your [signatures](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new?title=signatures"" ""Page does not exist."").

To compose a message from your new account, select the account in the Folder panel and click the Write button.

<h1 id=""w_what-is-a-scam"">What is a scam?</h1>
<p>A scam message contains material designed to trick the recipient into disclosing personal information. For example, a message might ask you to click a link and enter your credit card number in order to receive a prize. There is, of course, no prize. Instead, the person who sent the message collects your credit card number.
</p><p>These kinds of attacks are called ""phishing"" (a variant on the idea of ""fishing"" for data, such as usernames, passwords or credit card numbers). Generally, data phishers send out mass emails that cleverly imitate the look and feel of messages from legitimate businesses (such as banks, large websites or retail stores). Some look like fancy form letters with headers and company logos. Some have email addresses that look like they originated from the company they claim to represent.
</p><p>In addition to the credit card phishing scam described above, phishers use several other tactics:
</p>
<ul><li> Telling you that your account on a website will be closed unless you click a link and re-enter your username and password. (This exposes your login information to the phisher.)
</li><li> Telling you that a software update is available, followed by a request for you to provide information or install malicious software on your computer.
</li><li> Telling you that there has been a charge on one of your accounts, or a change to your account status and prompting you to follow the link in the message to correct the problem.
</li></ul>
<h1 id=""w_what-is-the-difference-between-spam-and-scams"">What is the difference between spam and scams?</h1>
<p>Both spam messages and scam messages are unsolicited and unwanted messages. However, spam messages are merely unwanted advertisements and are not dangerous, only annoying.

Scam messages, however, are malicious because they want your personal information for nefarious purposes (identity theft, credit card scams, bank account access, etc.).

# Protecting yourself from scams

To protect yourself against scams, you must use a combination of Thunderbird's built-in scam detection tools combined with your own common sense and skepticism.

## Thunderbird's automatic scam filtering

Thunderbird uses its built-in scam filtering that is part of [the junk filtering](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages"") functions. It looks for characteristics in messages that are common in scam messages, for example:

- Links with numerical server names (http://127.0.0.1/).
- Links where the text doesn't match the server name (for example, the text of the message might say ""[https://secure.example.com](https://secure.example.com)"" but the link actually goes to ""[http://phishing.example.com](http://phishing.example.com)"" instead). Phishers do this to fool you into going to their site. Unfortunately some legitimate mailing lists also do this with redirectors for tracking purposes.
- A remote image link that has different image source than the link points to (spoofing a legitimate web site, similar to the link spoofing described above).

When Thunderbird detects that a message could be a potential phishing attempt, it will display a warning at the top of the message saying that ""_This message may be a scam_"":

![scam warning](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

As a second line of defense, Thunderbird warns you when you click a link in a message that appears to be taking you to a different website than the one indicated by the URL in the message:

### Why does Thunderbird tell me that a legitimate message is a scam?

Thunderbird's detection algorithm isn't perfect and, unlike its spam filter, does not learn or adapt based on your email flags. If you are getting too many false alerts, you may consider (at your own risk) disabling it:

1. In the menu bar, click the Thunderbird menu and select Settings.Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and choose Settings.

3. Uncheck the box.

![scam options](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

## Be skeptical about email messages

Your best defense is to be aware of scam tactics and be skeptical about your email messages.

- Don't click on links in emails unless you are absolutely sure that the sender is legitimate. Instead, use your browser to search for the site. For example, if you receive a message that says you should change your password on your online bank account, do not click the link in the message. Instead, use your browser to navigate to the bank's site (using the URL from your bookmarks, favorites, or from search) and check if the request is real.
- Don't reply to a message that asks you for your personal information.
- Use a recent version of a browser that implements a phishing filter, such as [the one used by Firefox](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-does-phishing-and-malware-protection-work"").

<h1 id=""w_what-are-saved-searches"">What are Saved Searches?</h1>
<p>A Saved Search is a special folder which shows a selection of messages which match your pre-defined search criteria. Saved Searches are a great way of saving time because instead of typing or recreating your most frequent searches again and again, you can just get immediate live results by looking at your Saved Search folder.
</p><p><img alt=""TB102-saved-search-folder-message-list"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2022-09-28-13-30-48-64a272.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</p><p>When you create a Saved Search, you can choose criteria such as email addresses, subject words, tags or dates. You can even choose different source folders from several accounts. Thunderbird then creates a folder which shows only matching messages. Actions on the messages shown in a Saved Search folder will apply directly to your original messages in the source folders. New matching messages from the specified source folders will automatically be shown in the Saved Search folder. 
</p><p>For example, you may want to view all messages from your high-school friends in their own folder named “Highschool”. Just add their email addresses to a Saved Search and their messages will automatically show up in the “Highschool” folder as they arrive. Yet the same messages will also still be shown in the source folders like your Inbox.
</p>
<div class=""warning""><strong>NOTE</strong>: Saved Searches display the <em>actual</em> matching messages of the source folders, <em>not copies</em> of those messages. <strong>Deleting messages in a Saved Search folder will remove them from Thunderbird entirely and normally also from the server of your email provider</strong>. However, deleting the Saved Search <em>folder itself</em> from the folder list will <em>not</em> remove the original messages it was displaying. So you can delete any Saved Searches you no longer need without having to worry about losing your messages.</div>

</li></ol>
<h1 id=""w_how-to-set-the-search-criteria"">How to set the search criteria</h1>
<ol><li>Choose one of three search modes:
<ul><li> Match all of the following: This creates an ""and"" query where all of the listed rules must apply for the message to be shown in the folder. 
</li><li> Match any of the following: This creates an ""or"" query where if any of the listed rules match a message, then the message will be shown in the folder.
</li><li> Match all messages: This means you have no search criteria and are just using the saved search to combine the contents of multiple folders and display them as a single folder.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Choose your criteria.<br>The filter criteria, also known as ""rules"", are each made up of three parts:
<ul><li> A property, for example “From”
</li><li> A test, for example “Contains”
</li><li> A value, for example “HighSchoolDude@example.com” 
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<dl><dt>This example matches messages from “HighSchoolDude@example.com”. 
</dt><dt>The tests and values will vary depending on the property you select.
</dt></dl>
<h1 id=""w_example-searches"">Example searches</h1>
<p>Saved searches are especially useful if you regularly receive a large number of messages, and have an ongoing need to quickly pick out those of special interest.
</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Example 1</strong>: You regularly receive messages from workplace colleagues that include important work-related documents as attachments. You could create this search:
</li></ul>
<p><img alt=""attachments example for saved searches"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-06-17-19-05-58-05192e.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title=""""> 
</p><p>Your new saved search folder “Unread work attachments” will show all messages that are unread, have attachments, and were sent from the ""MyWorkplace"" domain. All future messages meeting all three criteria will show up in your new folder as well.
</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Example 2</strong>: You like to filter out lower-priority messages to reduce clutter. For example you may have chosen to receive notifications from businesses you patronize, but like to quickly read and dispose of those messages. You could create a saved search like this:
</li></ul>
<p><img alt=""promotions example for saved searches"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-06-17-19-08-04-1b1ecb.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title=""""> 
</p><p>Your new saved search folder “Promotional Stuff” will show any messages that are from the address “sales@software.biz”, OR have “discount” in the subject line, OR have the word “customer” somewhere in the address or display name (“customer.service”, “Customer Support” etc.) After a quick read you can then delete those messages individually.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_properties"">Properties</h1>
<p>The most commonly used properties are described below.
</p><p><img alt=""Properties dropdown for saved searches"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-06-17-19-52-12-74693d.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title=""""> 
</p><p>The following properties refer to the email message “headers” (as opposed to content in the body of the message):
</p>
<ul><li> From 
</li><li> To
</li><li> Cc 
</li><li> To or Cc
</li><li> From, To, Cc or Bcc
</li></ul>
<p>The sender and recipient properties can contain one or more email addresses, and sometimes also a display name. In the example ""John Doe"" &lt;johndoe@example.com&gt;, ""John Doe"" is the display name, and ""johndoe@example.com"" is the email address. When you enter the value for the search, Thunderbird will search for the value in both the display name and the email address. For example,  if your filter is: 
</p><p><span class=""pref"">From | Is | ""johndoe@example.com""</span>
</p><p>Thunderbird checks if the display name ""John Doe"" is the same as ""johndoe@example.com"" (which fails) and also if the email address is the same as ""johndoe@example.com"" (which succeeds).
</p>
<div class=""note""><strong>TIP</strong>: Using the email address in a filter is more accurate than using the display name. The author of the email provides the display name, and sometimes the display name will be omitted or different from the address.</div> 
<p>Searches are case-insensitive, so capitalization does not matter. If the sender of the message used ""JohnDoe@Example.com"", it would still succeed when compared with our test value of ""johndoe@example.com"". Searches on display names are also case-insensitive.
</p>
<div class=""note""><strong>TIP</strong>: In addition to checking messages for specific individuals, you can also use this filter to see if people involved in the message list are in your address book or not. Use the “is in my address book” / “is not in my address book” for the test, then specify an address book as the value. If you create a custom address book with relevant names, you can use this to specify a group of people in a saved search without adding them individually.</div>
<p><strong>Tags</strong>
</p><p>Tags are used to mark messages with a special designation and highlight color. Thunderbird provides the tags <strong>Important</strong>, <strong>Work</strong>, <strong>Personal</strong>, <strong>To Do</strong>, and <strong>Later</strong>, as well as the ability to create custom tags.
</p><p><span class=""pref"">Contains</span>: Succeeds if the tag is present on the message.
</p><p><span class=""pref"">Doesn't Contain</span>: Succeeds as long as the tag is not present on the message.
</p><p><span class=""pref"">Is</span>: Succeeds if the message has only the specified tag present. So if your filter is <span class=""pref"">Tag | Is | Important</span>, a message tagged with ""Important"" and ""Work"" would not match until the ""Work"" tag is removed.
</p><p><span class=""pref"">Isn’t</span>: Fails if the message has only the specified tag present. So if your filter is <span class=""pref"">Tag | Isn’t | Important</span>, then a message tagged with ""Important"" and ""Work"" would match until the ""Work"" tag is removed, at which point it would fail to match.
</p><p><span class=""pref"">IsEmpty</span>: Succeeds if the message has no tags applied.
</p><p><span class=""pref"">Isn’tEmpty</span>: Succeeds if the message has any tags applied.
</p>
<div class=""note""><strong>NOTE</strong>: Starred and unstarred messages are checked by adding the filter <span class=""pref"">Status | Is (or Isn't) | Starred</span>.</div>
<p><strong>Subject</strong>
</p><p>This lets you check the subject of a message. It will include the ""Re: "" prefix if one is present, but ignores capitalization.
</p><p><strong>Body</strong>
</p><p>This lets you check for the presence of a word or phrase in the message body. These searches are subject to some important limitations:
</p>
<ul><li> Saved searches do not support “word stemming,” the functionality that removes or transforms suffixes so that different variations of a word will all match. For example, ""runner"", ""runs"", and ""running"" all stem to the same root (“run”), but in saved searches only the specified word will match. (Thunderbird’s Global Search supports stemming.)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Saved searches will not search across line breaks in the message. For example, if you want to search for the phrase ""let's party!"", it will only match as long as the complete phrase appears in a single line of the message.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Searching the body of a message can be time-consuming. Thunderbird has to read the contents of a message from the hard drive. 
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Date and Age in Days</strong>
</p><p>The <span class=""pref"">Date</span> property lets you check the date of the message (as provided by the author of the message, not when you received it) against a specific date you provide as the value.
</p><p>The <span class=""pref"">Age in Days</span> property lets you check the age of the message (using the date provided by the author of the message, not when you received it). The age is always calculated using the instant the message is checked for a match.
</p><p><strong>Attachment Status</strong>
</p><p>The <span class=""pref"">Attachment Status</span> property lets you check whether messages have attachments (by using <span class=""pref"">Is | Has Attachments</span>) or have no attachments (by using <span class=""pref"">Isn’t | Has Attachments</span>) . 
</p>
<div class=""note""><strong>NOTE</strong>: If your saved search includes messages that are stored on a remote server, as opposed to your local system, Thunderbird may not be entirely accurate with this analysis. The software does not know specific details about messages until the messages are downloaded, which occurs when you click on a message.</div>
<p><strong>Tests and values</strong>
</p><p><span class=""pref"">Is / isn't</span>: Checks if either the display name or email address match the value provided in the filter, ignoring differences in capitalization. Use this to match specific email addresses.
</p><p><span class=""pref"">Is in my address book / isn't in my address book</span>: Use this to match multiple email addresses, and possibly as a shorthand for people whose messages are important to you. For the value, choose between Personal Address Book and Collected Addresses: 
</p>
<ul><li> Personal Address Book is made up of addresses which are added when you click the star next to the sender’s name in the message reader.
</li><li> Collected Addresses is made up of all the people you have sent messages to on the computer you’re currently using. Thunderbird maintains this list automatically.
</li></ul>
<div class=""note""><strong>NOTE</strong>: On Mac OS X, the system address book may also be present.</div>
<p><span class=""pref"">Ends with</span>: Checks if the display name or email address ends with the provided value, ignoring differences in capitalization. You might use this with something like ""@example.com"" to match all the email addresses from a single domain.
</p><p><span class=""pref"">Begins with</span>: Checks if the display name or email addres starts with the provided value, ignoring difference in capitalization. You might use this with something like ""webmaster@"" to match emails to webmasters across multiple domains.
</p><p><span class=""pref"">Contains / doesn't contain</span>: Checks if the provided value can be found anywhere in the display name or email address, ignoring differences in capitalization. Use this test cautiously because it can often match things you don't actually want it to match. Consider using ""is"" or ""ends with"" instead.

# What are Saved Searches?

A Saved Search is a special folder which shows a selection of messages which match your pre-defined search criteria. Saved Searches are a great way of saving time because instead of typing or recreating your most frequent searches again and again, you can just get immediate live results by looking at your Saved Search folder.

![TB102-saved-search-folder-message-list](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

When you create a Saved Search, you can choose criteria such as email addresses, subject words, tags or dates. You can even choose different source folders from several accounts. Thunderbird then creates a folder which shows only matching messages. Actions on the messages shown in a Saved Search folder will apply directly to your original messages in the source folders. New matching messages from the specified source folders will automatically be shown in the Saved Search folder.

For example, you may want to view all messages from your high-school friends in their own folder named “Highschool”. Just add their email addresses to a Saved Search and their messages will automatically show up in the “Highschool” folder as they arrive. Yet the same messages will also still be shown in the source folders like your Inbox.

**NOTE** : Saved Searches display the _actual_ matching messages of the source folders, _not copies_ of those messages. **Deleting messages in a Saved Search folder will remove them from Thunderbird entirely and normally also from the server of your email provider**. However, deleting the Saved Search _folder itself_ from the folder list will _not_ remove the original messages it was displaying. So you can delete any Saved Searches you no longer need without having to worry about losing your messages.

# How to create a Saved Search folder

1. From the File menu, click New, and then Saved Search from the sub-menu. The **New Saved Search Folder** dialog appears.  
  
 ![TB102-new-saved-search-folder-jane](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)
2. Change the **Name** for your Saved Search as you want to have it in the folder list. The folder that was selected when you opened the **New Saved Search Folder** dialog in step 1 will be displayed as the default name and location.
3. Click the **Create as a subfolder of** dropdown if you wish to change the parent folder.
4. To select the folders to search, click the Choose button. A dialog will be displayed that contains a hierarchical view of all the folders in all of your accounts. Select the check box next to each folder you wish to include in the search.  
  
 ![TB102-saved-search-folder-select-folders](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)
**Tip** : If you want to include a number of folders that are next to each other in the list, click on the row of the first folder (not in the check box), then press Shift and click on the last folder. Then press the Spacebar to select the check box of all the highlighted folders (pressing Spacebar again will clear the check boxes).  
  
**Note** : You can include as many folders as you like in your saved search, but each folder you add will cause the search to take longer. Only select the folders that you need.
5. If your messages are not stored on your local system for offline access (for example, if they are stored on a central IMAP server), check Search Online. This is only necessary if you are filtering based on the body of the message, as addresses and the subject line are stored locally even if you leave the message body on the server.
**TIP** : In most cases, searching online is unnecessary and will slow your search down. An offline search is conducted locally on your computer, while an online search uses your mail server to do the search. Offline searches are much faster and Thunderbird's auto-sync mechanism automatically keeps your folders up-to-date.

# How to set the search criteria

1. Choose one of three search modes:
  - Match all of the following: This creates an ""and"" query where all of the listed rules must apply for the message to be shown in the folder. 
  - Match any of the following: This creates an ""or"" query where if any of the listed rules match a message, then the message will be shown in the folder.
  - Match all messages: This means you have no search criteria and are just using the saved search to combine the contents of multiple folders and display them as a single folder.
2. Choose your criteria.  
The filter criteria, also known as ""rules"", are each made up of three parts:
  - A property, for example “From”
  - A test, for example “Contains”
  - A value, for example “HighSchoolDude@example.com” 
<dl>
<dt>This example matches messages from “HighSchoolDude@example.com”. 
</dt>
<dt>The tests and values will vary depending on the property you select.
</dt>
</dl>
# Example searches

Saved searches are especially useful if you regularly receive a large number of messages, and have an ongoing need to quickly pick out those of special interest.

- **Example 1** : You regularly receive messages from workplace colleagues that include important work-related documents as attachments. You could create this search:

![attachments example for saved searches](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

Your new saved search folder “Unread work attachments” will show all messages that are unread, have attachments, and were sent from the ""MyWorkplace"" domain. All future messages meeting all three criteria will show up in your new folder as well.

- **Example 2** : You like to filter out lower-priority messages to reduce clutter. For example you may have chosen to receive notifications from businesses you patronize, but like to quickly read and dispose of those messages. You could create a saved search like this:

![promotions example for saved searches](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

Your new saved search folder “Promotional Stuff” will show any messages that are from the address “sales@software.biz”, OR have “discount” in the subject line, OR have the word “customer” somewhere in the address or display name (“customer.service”, “Customer Support” etc.) After a quick read you can then delete those messages individually.

# Properties

The most commonly used properties are described below.

![Properties dropdown for saved searches](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

The following properties refer to the email message “headers” (as opposed to content in the body of the message):

- From 
- To
- Cc 
- To or Cc
- From, To, Cc or Bcc

The sender and recipient properties can contain one or more email addresses, and sometimes also a display name. In the example ""John Doe"" \<johndoe@example.com\>, ""John Doe"" is the display name, and ""johndoe@example.com"" is the email address. When you enter the value for the search, Thunderbird will search for the value in both the display name and the email address. For example, if your filter is:

From | Is | ""johndoe@example.com""

Thunderbird checks if the display name ""John Doe"" is the same as ""johndoe@example.com"" (which fails) and also if the email address is the same as ""johndoe@example.com"" (which succeeds).

**TIP** : Using the email address in a filter is more accurate than using the display name. The author of the email provides the display name, and sometimes the display name will be omitted or different from the address.

Searches are case-insensitive, so capitalization does not matter. If the sender of the message used ""JohnDoe@Example.com"", it would still succeed when compared with our test value of ""johndoe@example.com"". Searches on display names are also case-insensitive.

**TIP** : In addition to checking messages for specific individuals, you can also use this filter to see if people involved in the message list are in your address book or not. Use the “is in my address book” / “is not in my address book” for the test, then specify an address book as the value. If you create a custom address book with relevant names, you can use this to specify a group of people in a saved search without adding them individually.

**Tags**

Tags are used to mark messages with a special designation and highlight color. Thunderbird provides the tags **Important** , **Work** , **Personal** , **To Do** , and **Later** , as well as the ability to create custom tags.

Contains: Succeeds if the tag is present on the message.

Doesn't Contain: Succeeds as long as the tag is not present on the message.

Is: Succeeds if the message has only the specified tag present. So if your filter is Tag | Is | Important, a message tagged with ""Important"" and ""Work"" would not match until the ""Work"" tag is removed.

Isn’t: Fails if the message has only the specified tag present. So if your filter is Tag | Isn’t | Important, then a message tagged with ""Important"" and ""Work"" would match until the ""Work"" tag is removed, at which point it would fail to match.

IsEmpty: Succeeds if the message has no tags applied.

Isn’tEmpty: Succeeds if the message has any tags applied.

**NOTE** : Starred and unstarred messages are checked by adding the filter Status | Is (or Isn't) | Starred.

**Subject**

This lets you check the subject of a message. It will include the ""Re: "" prefix if one is present, but ignores capitalization.

**Body**

This lets you check for the presence of a word or phrase in the message body. These searches are subject to some important limitations:

- Saved searches do not support “word stemming,” the functionality that removes or transforms suffixes so that different variations of a word will all match. For example, ""runner"", ""runs"", and ""running"" all stem to the same root (“run”), but in saved searches only the specified word will match. (Thunderbird’s Global Search supports stemming.)

- Saved searches will not search across line breaks in the message. For example, if you want to search for the phrase ""let's party!"", it will only match as long as the complete phrase appears in a single line of the message.

- Searching the body of a message can be time-consuming. Thunderbird has to read the contents of a message from the hard drive. 

**Date and Age in Days**

The Date property lets you check the date of the message (as provided by the author of the message, not when you received it) against a specific date you provide as the value.

The Age in Days property lets you check the age of the message (using the date provided by the author of the message, not when you received it). The age is always calculated using the instant the message is checked for a match.

**Attachment Status**

The Attachment Status property lets you check whether messages have attachments (by using Is | Has Attachments) or have no attachments (by using Isn’t | Has Attachments) .

**NOTE** : If your saved search includes messages that are stored on a remote server, as opposed to your local system, Thunderbird may not be entirely accurate with this analysis. The software does not know specific details about messages until the messages are downloaded, which occurs when you click on a message.

**Tests and values**

Is / isn't: Checks if either the display name or email address match the value provided in the filter, ignoring differences in capitalization. Use this to match specific email addresses.

Is in my address book / isn't in my address book: Use this to match multiple email addresses, and possibly as a shorthand for people whose messages are important to you. For the value, choose between Personal Address Book and Collected Addresses:

- Personal Address Book is made up of addresses which are added when you click the star next to the sender’s name in the message reader.
- Collected Addresses is made up of all the people you have sent messages to on the computer you’re currently using. Thunderbird maintains this list automatically.

**NOTE** : On Mac OS X, the system address book may also be present.

Ends with: Checks if the display name or email address ends with the provided value, ignoring differences in capitalization. You might use this with something like ""@example.com"" to match all the email addresses from a single domain.

Begins with: Checks if the display name or email addres starts with the provided value, ignoring difference in capitalization. You might use this with something like ""webmaster@"" to match emails to webmasters across multiple domains.

Contains / doesn't contain: Checks if the provided value can be found anywhere in the display name or email address, ignoring differences in capitalization. Use this test cautiously because it can often match things you don't actually want it to match. Consider using ""is"" or ""ends with"" instead.

# The Basics

As soon as you’ve [set up an email account](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-account-configuration""), you’re ready to start sending and receiving messages in Thunderbird. Here’s how to do it.

## Sending a new message

1. In the Thunderbird toolbar, click the + New Message button (labelled with a red **1** in the following screenshot). The **Write window** opens (also known as _composition window_).<dl><dt>
<br><img alt=""tb115-new-message-get-messages-folder-pane-options"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2023-05-25-21-21-06-24e829.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>
2. In the **To** field, type the email address of a person you want to send the message to. Press Enter or Tab after each address to turn it into a recipient item (also known as a recipient _pill_). You can also use the CC and BCC disclosure buttons or \>\> to add other types of recipients. After entering all recipients, press Enter again to move on to the subject field.<dl>
<dt>
<br><strong>For detailed information on addressing and using recipient items efficiently, please refer to the <a href='\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/addressing-email""'>Addressing an Email</a> article.</strong>

<strong>Tip: Enter recipients faster with autocomplete</strong><br>When you send a message, Thunderbird will automatically save the email addresses of all the recipients in your address book. When you write a new message, Thunderbird will then autocomplete known addresses from your address book as you type them.

</dt>
</dl>
3. In the **Subject** field, type the subject of your message, then press Enter or Tab to move on to the message pane.
4. Type and format your message in the message pane.

**Tip** : You can customize the appearance of your message with Thunderbird’s word-processing functions in the Formatting Bar above the message pane. You can easily apply text formatting or insert links, images, tables, or smileys e.g. '😁'. Thunderbird will automatically send formatted messages in HTML format and unformatted messages as plain text.

1. Click the Send button, or press CtrlCmd+Enter.

**Note** : Thunderbird will save a copy of your sent messages in the **Sent** folder of your account.

## Receiving messages

By default, Thunderbird checks for new messages every time you open the application. It will also automatically check again every 10 minutes, while the application is running. This behavior for both actions can be customized ([see below](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/sending-and-receiving-messages-thunderbird#w_automatically-checking-for-new-messages)).

To check for messages at any other time, click the ![tb115-official-getmessages-icon16x16](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) button in the toolbar.

## Customizing how messages are sent and received

Get Thunderbird flying the way you want it! Many settings can easily be customized.

### Automatically checking for new messages

Set how often you want Thunderbird to automatically check for messages:

1. Click ≡ \> Account Settings.
2. On the accounts pane, click **Server Settings** beneath your account.
3. Choose the time interval for checking in the **Check for new messages every** setting. If you don't want Thunderbird to check automatically, uncheck this setting.
4. To enable or disable automatically checking for new messages at startup, check or uncheck **Check for new messages at startup**.

### Auto-saving

When you’re writing a new message, your work is auto-saved every five minutes, but you can make it more often, or less:

1. Click ≡ \> Settings.
2. Choose **Composition**.
3. Choose the time interval for auto-save in the **Auto Save every** setting. If you don't want Thunderbird to save automatically, uncheck this setting.

4. Click the Browse… button.
5. Choose your sound file and click the Open button.
6. You can preview the soundfile by clicking the Play button.

### Marking messages as read

Thunderbird displays _unread_ messages in bold type, marking a message _read_ and in normal type as soon as you click on the message. If you don't like this behavior, you can change the time interval before Thunderbird marks messages as read:

1. Click ≡ \> Settings
2. Choose **General**.
3. Go to _Reading & Display_ section.
4. Choose the **After displaying for … seconds** option and set how long Thunderbird should delay before marking a message as read.

# Advanced

## Configuring email accounts

When Thunderbird downloads messages, it uses the configuration on the _Server Settings_ page of each email account. Each email address corresponds to one incoming mail server (either POP or IMAP). To change your accounts server settings:

1. Click ≡ \> Account Settings.
2. On the accounts pane, click **Server Settings** beneath your account.

Thunderbird sends messages to the SMTP server that is assigned to the selected email account:

1. Click ≡ \> Account Settings.
2. On the accounts pane, scroll down the account list. The last item is the **Outgoing Server (SMTP)**. Click this item.
3. Select a server from the list and click the Edit… button.
4. Make your changes in the _SMTP Server_ window, and click OK to save your changes and to close the window.

Next, the Outgoing SMTP server is assigned to each account:

1. Click the account and select the desired server from the **Outgoing Server (SMTP)** drop-down list.

Each email account is listed in the _All Folders_ panel on the left side of the Thunderbird interface. For information about manually configuring email accounts, see [Manual Account Configuration](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manual-account-configuration""). For information about automatically configuring new email accounts, see [Automatic Account Configuration](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-account-configuration"").

## Downloading incoming messages

By default, Thunderbird will check your mail server(s) for new messages on application startup and then _automatically_ as described earlier in this article. In addition to that, you can check for new messages _manually_ at any time.

To **get new messages _for the currently selected account_** , you can use any one of the following methods:

- Use the [keyboard shortcut](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-thunderbird"").
- Right-click (control click on macOS) the account in the folder pane and select Get Messages.
- From the menu bar:
  - Click the File menu.
  - Select Get New Messages for and click Current Account from the sub-menu (where _Current Account_ is the account highlighted in the folder pane).

To **get new messages _for all accounts_** , you can use any one of the following methods:

- Click the ![tb115-official-getmessages-icon16x16](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) button in the top left corner of Thunderbird's main window.
- Use the [keyboard shortcut](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-thunderbird"").
- From the menu bar:
  - Click the File menu.
  - Choose Get New Messages for and click All Accounts from the sub-menu.

## Composing a new message

To compose a new message, you can use any one of the following methods:

- From the Application menu button: ≡ \> Create \> Message.
- Click the + New Message button in the _Mail Toolbar_.
- In the Thunderbird menu bar, click the Message menu and select New Message.
- Use the [keyboard shortcut](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-thunderbird"").

If an email (or newsgroup) account is highlighted in the _Folder Pane_, the message's _From_ address will default to the selected account. If no account is specified, the _From_ address will default to the first account configured in the _Account Settings_. Click the **From** drop-down list to select a different account.

For more details about adding and handling recipient items (aka recipient pills) in the addressing area, including more information about recipient autocompletion, please refer to [Addressing an Email](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/addressing-email"").

To insert a recipient from your address book, you can just start typing the person's name in the desired recipient field, for example the **To** field. A drop-down list will show all address book entries where the first or last name starts with the character(s) you entered, or entries where the string you entered exists. For example, if you enter **se** , anyone in the address book with the last name of _Serrano_, or _Casey_ or the first name of _Sean_, or _Jesse_ would be displayed in the drop-down list.

You can also drag and drop addresses from your address book to a new message. Simply open the address book, select the desired entry and drag it to the recipient area of the new message.

## Replying to a message

To reply to a message, you can use any one of the following methods:

- Click the Reply or Reply All button in the message header toolbar when the message is displayed.
- Right-click the message in the Message List and select Reply to Sender Only (CtrlCommand + R), Reply to All (CtrlCommand + Shift + R) or Reply to List (CtrlCommand + Shift + L).

## Move to a folder

You may like to filter out lower-priority messages from your Inbox to reduce clutter. For example you may have chosen to receive notifications from businesses you patronize, but like to keep them in a separate folder.

First, create a folder called “Promotions” (or something similar) by clicking File \> New \> Folder. You could then create a filter like this:

**Note** : While you can also use filters to catch and dispose of junk email – that is, promotions you DIDN’T sign up for – it’s not recommended.

<div class=""note""><strong>NOTE</strong>: Thunderbird will validate new feed urls and let you check for correct protocol syntax in an existing feed. For already added feeds, click the <strong>Validate</strong> link in the Feed Subscriptions dialog. If a feed does not Validate in Thunderbird (for example, if it is a web page), it may, however, appear to be correct in the <a href=""http://validator.w3.org/feed/"">Validation Service</a>. This is because the Service will attempt to locate a valid link. Check that the Service's link is the same as the link you entered in Thunderbird. (A web page may have more than one feed url in it; the Service will use the first one it finds.)</div>
<h1 id=""w_step-3-read-your-feeds"">Step 3: Read your Feeds</h1>
<p>Reading your feeds is as easy as using your email in Thunderbird.
</p>
<ol><li> Click <span class=""button"">Get Messages</span> to download all the newest feed messages, along with your regular email messages. If you right click on a specific folder and select <span class=""menu"">Get Messages</span>, only messages for that folder's subscriptions (and all of its subfolders) will be retrieved.
</li><li> In the folder pane, click on the folder whose content you want to read. A list of unread messages from the feed appears in the message list pane.
</li><li> Click on a message in the message list.
</li><li> Read the article in the message body. If you’d like to see the article on the website, click the link in the message header next to <strong>Website</strong> (this will open the link in your default browser).

</dt></dl>
</li><li> You may also select the view action to perform when double clicking or hitting &lt;enter&gt; on a feed message selected in the list. The options are found in <span class=""menu"">Message &gt; When Opening Feed Messages</span>. 
</li></ol>
<div class=""note""><strong>NOTE</strong>: You can set whether the message displays as an article summary or the article web page in two ways:
<ul><li> In the Feed Subscriptions dialog, select the feed folder and check the <strong>Show the article summary instead of loading the web page</strong> box. This preference applies to all feeds in the folder.
</li><li> Select a message from the message list, then click <span class=""menu"">View &gt; Feed Message Body As</span>, and select whether to use the <span class=""menu"">Default Format</span> (folder setting above), or override the default and show <span class=""menu"">Summary</span> or <span class=""menu"">Web Page</span> globally.
</li></ul>
In <span class=""menu"">Tools &gt; Account Settings</span>, select the name of your Feed Account and check the <strong>By default, show the article summary instead of loading the web page</strong> box. This selection is the default for all <strong>new</strong> feed subscriptions that create a folder in that Account.</div>
<h1 id=""w_step-4-organize-and-manage-your-feeds"">Step 4: Organize and Manage your Feeds</h1>
<h2 id=""w_folders-and-accounts"">Folders and Accounts</h2>
<p>You can create email-style folders to group individual feeds:
</p>
<ol><li> In the folderpane, click on your Feeds Account name to select it.
</li><li> Click <span class=""menu"">File &gt; New &gt; Folder</span>. The <strong>New Folder</strong> dialog box appears.
</li><li> Type a name for your new folder, then click <span class=""button"">Create Folder</span>. To create subfolders of your folders, first select the folder you want as the parent folder, then click <span class=""menu"">File &gt; New &gt; Subfolder</span>.
</li><li> Alternatively, you can organize your feeds by creating additional Feed Accounts. Just repeat step 1 for every account you want to create, giving each one a different name. Multiple accounts are less useful now that individual feed update intervals have been implemented.
</li></ol>
<div class=""note""><strong>NOTE</strong>: A Feed Account subfolder may contain zero, one, or many subscriptions. Only one unique feed url may be subscribed to per account.</div>
<h2 id=""w_the-feed-subscriptions-dialog"">The Feed Subscriptions dialog</h2>
<ol><li> From a folderpane folder it is easy to go directly to managing feeds by right clicking and selecting the <span class=""menu"">Subscribe…</span> menu item.
</li><li> The dialog will open with the folder selected and opened, showing the folder's feed subscriptions.
</li><li> Feeds may be drag-and-dropped and otherwise organized in folders however you like. For example, it is useful to have a blog feed and its comments feed both subscribed to the same folder. (Publishers may even construct their feeds so items thread together as in email!)
</li></ol>
<div class=""note""><strong>NOTE</strong>: Moving or removing a feed subscription from a folder will not affect already downloaded articles in any way. If you remove a feed url subscription, the currently active items list is also cleaned up. As a result, resubscribing the feed url will cause already downloaded messages to be stored again. Deleting a folder or moving it to trash automatically unsubscribes all feeds from the folder.</div>
<h2 id=""w_updates"">Updates</h2>
<p>Starting in Thunderbird 60, each feed's update interval may be individually set. If the checkbox <strong>Check for new articles</strong> is unchecked, the feed is 'paused'. If all feeds in a folder are paused, the folder is paused and will appear in lower opacity. A folder may also be paused/unpaused using the context menu -- the status will apply to all feeds in the folder. The entire account may also be paused (this does not change any individual feed's pause state).
</p><p>You may still get updates immediately by clicking <span class=""button"">Get Messages</span> even if an account or folder is paused. 
</p>
<h2 id=""w_automatic-tagging"">Automatic Tagging</h2>
<p>If the publisher adds &lt;category&gt; tags to feed items, you may choose to autotag feed articles with these values. A &lt;category&gt; value corresponds to one keyword tag in Thunderbird. A feed item may have numerous &lt;category&gt; tags.
</p>
<ol><li> In the Feed Subscriptions dialog, select the feed and check the <strong>Automatically create tags from feed &lt;category&gt; names</strong> box.
</li><li> You may also add a custom prefix to better differentiate tags.
</li></ol>
<p>The tags are stored in the <strong>Keywords:</strong> header (RFC5322 compliant) for portability. They are also tagged by Thunderbird's internal system and stored in the <strong>X-Mozilla-Keys:</strong> header of the article. As a result, tags will appear in the message header and work with the Quick Filter and Message Filters and Searches tag rules. 
</p>
<h2 id=""w_import-and-export-your-feeds"">Import and Export your Feeds</h2>
<ol><li> If you have a list of feed urls exported in the OPML format to a file, perhaps from another feed reader, you may Import them using <span class=""menu"">Tools &gt; Import &gt; Feed Subscriptions</span>. Choose either a new or existing Feed Account.
</li><li> You may also Import using the Feed Subscriptions dialog, selecting the Feed Account folder, and clicking <span class=""button"">Import</span>.
</li><li> To Export, select the Feed Account (top folder) in the Feed Subscriptions dialog and click <span class=""button"">Export</span>. The folder structure and preferences of your feeds will be saved to a .opml file. (To Export a simple list, press <span class=""key"">Ctrl</span> then click the button).
</li></ol>
<h1 id=""w_tips"">Tips</h1>
<ul><li> To quickly mark a feed folder's messages as all read, so they no longer appear in bold type, press <span class=""key"">Shift</span> + <span class=""key"">C</span> while the folder is selected.
</li><li> To set how often Thunderbird checks for new feed messages and other default feed properties for <strong>new subscriptions only</strong>, click on <span class=""menu"">Tools &gt; Account Settings</span> or <span class=""menu"">Edit &gt; Account Settings</span> to open the dialog, then click on the name of your Feed Account. Set the values in the <strong>Default Settings for New Feeds</strong> section.
</li><li> Feed article retention is managed just like for email. Click on <span class=""menu"">Disc Space</span> below your Feed Account name in <span class=""menu"">Account Settings</span> for more options.
</li><li> Use the <a href=""/en-US/kb/quick-filter-toolbar"">Quick Filter toolbar</a> to save time if you're getting a lot of messages from a feed.
</li><li> If you wish to use Message Filters on feed messages and filter by website, create a Custom header named <em>Content-Base</em>. This header contains the feed message's website link.
</li><li> Feed articles may be placed in 'the cloud' by setting up a filter to copy or move items to an IMAP account folder. This is not true syncing in any way, but may be useful in some cases. The filter bug to enable this feature has been fixed in Thunderbird 38.
</li></ul>
<h1 id=""w_tips-for-publishers"">Tips for Publishers</h1>
<ul><li> The <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287"">Atom specification</a> is strongly recommended. If you use the <a href=""http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification"">RSS2.0 spec</a>, a &lt;guid&gt; is recommended. Also, &lt;title&gt; and &lt;link&gt; are mandatory per spec and the feed will be rejected if they are not present. Another common error is representing unicode characters with octals. Ensure dates are represented according to the chosen specification; bad dates may cause items to be rejected. Please always <strong>follow the specs</strong> and <a href=""http://validator.w3.org/feed/"">validate</a> and everyone will win.
</li><li> The <strong>Last-Modified</strong> header should be returned in your server's response. Thunderbird will send this value in <strong>If-Modified-Since</strong> in its next request to your server, which you can respond to with code 304 if appropriate. This saves unnecessary bandwidth usage and processing if there are no new items or changes to your file.
</li><li> If you use Atom and its <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4685.txt"">threading extension</a>, Thunderbird will group related feed items (like comments to a post) into <strong>threads</strong> just like it does with related email messages.
</li><li> Changes to feed urls can be detected by Thunderbird and updated automatically for users. See <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=304917"">Bug 304917</a> for two ways of doing this.
</li><li> New in Thunderbird 60: A <strong>Publisher recommends:</strong> update frequency is shown to the user in the Feed Subscriptions dialog if the relevant tags are included in your feed. Follow the  <a href=""http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/"">Syndication specification</a> to advertise your desired update frequency.
</li></ul>
<h1 id=""w_advanced-tips"">Advanced Tips</h1>
<ul><li> The feed update frequency in <strong>Check for new articles</strong> should be set to minimize unnecessary bandwidth usage and Thunderbird processing, if the publisher is not using <strong>Last-Modified</strong> above. If it is being used, an immediate <strong>There are no new articles for this feed</strong> message appears in the status bar when manually getting new messages for the folder twice quickly.
</li><li> A feed url may be added without being online; <strong>adding in offline mode</strong> will bypass feed validation. If offline (to go offline, click the status bar icon), a dialog will appear asking to go online for new messages. Cancel the prompt and the feed will be added. The feed's Title will be the url and may be edited. Once back online, Thunderbird may fail the feed for invalid url or syntax, but it will exist in the database.
</li><li> Display of a feed item summary or web page may be fine tuned by setting the following two prefs using the <a href=""/en-US/kb/config-editor"">Config Editor</a>.<br><div class=""note""><span class=""pref"">rss.show.content-base</span><br>Action on double click or enter in threadpane for a feed message:<br><code>0 - open web page in new window<br>1 - open summary in new window<br>2 - toggle load summary and web page in message pane<br>3 - load web page in browser<br></code></div><div class=""note""><span class=""pref"">rss.message.loadWebPageOnSelect</span><br>Additional action on feed message select:<br><code>0 - no action<br>1 - load web page in default browser<br></code></div>
</li><li> New in Thunderbird 60: Users with very many feeds may choose to limit the number of feeds simultaneously being processed by setting the pref <span class=""pref"">rss.max_concurrent_feeds</span> in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/config-editor"">Config Editor</a>. The default is <span class=""pref"">25</span>.
</li><li> New in Thunderbird 60: Feed folders that contain a subscription url that is in error (server not reachable, feed file not found, certificate error, etc.) will be indicated with an icon. Open the Feed Subscriptions dialog, select the feed and focus the Feed URL, and click the <span class=""button"">Verify</span> button to <strong>check for network type problems</strong>.
</li><li> Thunderbird has extensive logging of feed activity, viewable in <span class=""menu"">Tools &gt; Developer Tools &gt; Error Console</span>. Change the preference <span class=""pref"">Feeds.logging.console</span> to <span class=""pref"">debug</span> or <span class=""pref"">trace</span> (and restart) to see details of feed processing.
</li></ul>
<h1 id=""w_troubleshooting-faq"">Troubleshooting FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Why are feed messages sometimes duplicated?</strong>
</p><p>A: Feed messages with identical content but different unique ids are not detected as duplicates. See <a href=""http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=13360829#p13360829"">this post</a> for many more details. 
</p><p><strong>Q: When viewing a feed web page, why does a browser sometimes open or a random page sometimes load in the browser?</strong>
</p><p>A: Since Thunderbird wasn't designed to be a web browser, it will send all link requests to your default browser. In this case, script on the feed web page is attempting to open a link. The best solution is to install the Adblock Plus extension. In addition to having extensive built in filters, Adblock Plus lets you configure custom urls or domains to be blocked. See also <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524281"">Bug 524281</a>.
</p><p><strong>Q: Why can't I see some images or video or documents or other embedded content when viewing a feed summary?</strong>
</p><p>A: This is due to JavaScript being disabled for messages (emails, newsgroup posts, feed summaries). The request to implement a user configurable option to enable JavaScript, for feed summaries only, is <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=456481"">Bug 456481</a>.

",thunderbird,news-feeds-rss-blogs-and-social-thunderbird," **NOTE** : This article applies to Thunderbird 52 and above.

Websites may publish content for download by applications using one of either the RSS or Atom protocols. Such content is commonly called a ""news feed"" or ""RSS feed"" or ""syndication"". Feeds are often used by blogs, but more traditional websites can make any content available in this format. When you subscribe to a site's feed link, your feed reader (for example, Thunderbird) automatically checks the location and downloads the articles to local folders.

When you use Thunderbird to handle your feeds, you can use the same presentation and tools (archiving, filters, search, etc.) that you are familiar with from managing your email messages.

# Step 1: Create a Feed Account

First you must create an account in Thunderbird for your feeds.

1. In the Menu Bar, click File \> New \> Feed Account. The **Feed Account Wizard** window appears.
2. Type a name for your Feed account in the **Account Name** box, then click Next.
3. Click Finish. Your new account will now appear in Thunderbird's folder pane.

# Step 2: Subscribe to Feeds

Next, choose the feeds you want to subscribe to.

1. Use your web browser to open a website that you want to subscribe to. Most media sites and blogs that are regularly updated have feeds.
2. Look for a familiar RSS icon or text link on the site. On most sites the link appears at the bottom or on the side of the home page.<dl><dt>
<img alt=""rss icon on website"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-08-06-18-00-56-56e1e0.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>
3. Right-click on the RSS link and copy the link’s address. (If you use Mozilla Firefox, click Copy Link Location on the context menu. If you use Google Chrome, click Copy link address.)<dl><dt>
<img alt=""copying rss link from website"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-08-06-18-00-21-149854.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title=""""> <div class=""note"">
<strong>NOTE</strong>: On some large websites, the home page’s rss or feeds hyperlink is not a feed itself, but a link to a set of feeds provided by the site. For example, a major media site may have different feeds for its news, sports and entertainment sections. Just click the RSS icon on the home page, then perform Step 3 on the page that hosts all the site’s feeds.</div>
</dt></dl>
4. In Thunderbird, click your Feed Account name in the folder pane.
5. Click **Manage subscriptions** to open the Feed Subscriptions dialog.
6. In the **Feed URL** box, right-click and paste the link address from the website.
7. Click Add. Thunderbird will validate the link, create a new folder, subscribe a valid link to the new folder, and download all current articles. The new folder appears under your Feed Account in the folder pane.<dl><dt>
<img alt=""rss subscriptions dialog"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-08-06-17-59-45-dc5cd3.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>
8. Feeds can also be quickly subscribed by drag and dropping links from a browser onto either the Feed Account folder or any other folder in a Feed Account, directly in the folder pane. If a new folder is created, the folder's name is derived from the feed's title.

**NOTE** : Thunderbird will validate new feed urls and let you check for correct protocol syntax in an existing feed. For already added feeds, click the **Validate** link in the Feed Subscriptions dialog. If a feed does not Validate in Thunderbird (for example, if it is a web page), it may, however, appear to be correct in the [Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org/feed/). This is because the Service will attempt to locate a valid link. Check that the Service's link is the same as the link you entered in Thunderbird. (A web page may have more than one feed url in it; the Service will use the first one it finds.)

# Step 3: Read your Feeds

Reading your feeds is as easy as using your email in Thunderbird.

1. Click Get Messages to download all the newest feed messages, along with your regular email messages. If you right click on a specific folder and select Get Messages, only messages for that folder's subscriptions (and all of its subfolders) will be retrieved.
2. In the folder pane, click on the folder whose content you want to read. A list of unread messages from the feed appears in the message list pane.
3. Click on a message in the message list.
4. Read the article in the message body. If you’d like to see the article on the website, click the link in the message header next to **Website** (this will open the link in your default browser).<dl><dt>
<img alt=""rss message view"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2012-08-06-18-01-21-206dd9.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>
5. You may also select the view action to perform when double clicking or hitting \<enter\> on a feed message selected in the list. The options are found in Message \> When Opening Feed Messages. 

**NOTE** : You can set whether the message displays as an article summary or the article web page in two ways:
- In the Feed Subscriptions dialog, select the feed folder and check the **Show the article summary instead of loading the web page** box. This preference applies to all feeds in the folder.
- Select a message from the message list, then click View \> Feed Message Body As, and select whether to use the Default Format (folder setting above), or override the default and show Summary or Web Page globally.
In Tools \> Account Settings, select the name of your Feed Account and check the **By default, show the article summary instead of loading the web page** box. This selection is the default for all **new** feed subscriptions that create a folder in that Account.

# Step 4: Organize and Manage your Feeds

## Folders and Accounts

You can create email-style folders to group individual feeds:

1. In the folderpane, click on your Feeds Account name to select it.
2. Click File \> New \> Folder. The **New Folder** dialog box appears.
3. Type a name for your new folder, then click Create Folder. To create subfolders of your folders, first select the folder you want as the parent folder, then click File \> New \> Subfolder.
4. Alternatively, you can organize your feeds by creating additional Feed Accounts. Just repeat step 1 for every account you want to create, giving each one a different name. Multiple accounts are less useful now that individual feed update intervals have been implemented.

**NOTE** : A Feed Account subfolder may contain zero, one, or many subscriptions. Only one unique feed url may be subscribed to per account.

## The Feed Subscriptions dialog

1. From a folderpane folder it is easy to go directly to managing feeds by right clicking and selecting the Subscribe… menu item.
2. The dialog will open with the folder selected and opened, showing the folder's feed subscriptions.
3. Feeds may be drag-and-dropped and otherwise organized in folders however you like. For example, it is useful to have a blog feed and its comments feed both subscribed to the same folder. (Publishers may even construct their feeds so items thread together as in email!)

**NOTE** : Moving or removing a feed subscription from a folder will not affect already downloaded articles in any way. If you remove a feed url subscription, the currently active items list is also cleaned up. As a result, resubscribing the feed url will cause already downloaded messages to be stored again. Deleting a folder or moving it to trash automatically unsubscribes all feeds from the folder.

## Updates

Starting in Thunderbird 60, each feed's update interval may be individually set. If the checkbox **Check for new articles** is unchecked, the feed is 'paused'. If all feeds in a folder are paused, the folder is paused and will appear in lower opacity. A folder may also be paused/unpaused using the context menu -- the status will apply to all feeds in the folder. The entire account may also be paused (this does not change any individual feed's pause state).

You may still get updates immediately by clicking Get Messages even if an account or folder is paused.

## Automatic Tagging

If the publisher adds \<category\> tags to feed items, you may choose to autotag feed articles with these values. A \<category\> value corresponds to one keyword tag in Thunderbird. A feed item may have numerous \<category\> tags.

1. In the Feed Subscriptions dialog, select the feed and check the **Automatically create tags from feed \<category\> names** box.
2. You may also add a custom prefix to better differentiate tags.

The tags are stored in the **Keywords:** header (RFC5322 compliant) for portability. They are also tagged by Thunderbird's internal system and stored in the **X-Mozilla-Keys:** header of the article. As a result, tags will appear in the message header and work with the Quick Filter and Message Filters and Searches tag rules.

## Import and Export your Feeds

1. If you have a list of feed urls exported in the OPML format to a file, perhaps from another feed reader, you may Import them using Tools \> Import \> Feed Subscriptions. Choose either a new or existing Feed Account.
2. You may also Import using the Feed Subscriptions dialog, selecting the Feed Account folder, and clicking Import.
3. To Export, select the Feed Account (top folder) in the Feed Subscriptions dialog and click Export. The folder structure and preferences of your feeds will be saved to a .opml file. (To Export a simple list, press Ctrl then click the button).

# Tips

- To quickly mark a feed folder's messages as all read, so they no longer appear in bold type, press Shift + C while the folder is selected.
- To set how often Thunderbird checks for new feed messages and other default feed properties for **new subscriptions only** , click on Tools \> Account Settings or Edit \> Account Settings to open the dialog, then click on the name of your Feed Account. Set the values in the **Default Settings for New Feeds** section.
- Feed article retention is managed just like for email. Click on Disc Space below your Feed Account name in Account Settings for more options.
- Use the [Quick Filter toolbar](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/quick-filter-toolbar"") to save time if you're getting a lot of messages from a feed.
- If you wish to use Message Filters on feed messages and filter by website, create a Custom header named _Content-Base_. This header contains the feed message's website link.
- Feed articles may be placed in 'the cloud' by setting up a filter to copy or move items to an IMAP account folder. This is not true syncing in any way, but may be useful in some cases. The filter bug to enable this feature has been fixed in Thunderbird 38.

# Tips for Publishers

- The [Atom specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287) is strongly recommended. If you use the [RSS2.0 spec](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification), a \<guid\> is recommended. Also, \<title\> and \<link\> are mandatory per spec and the feed will be rejected if they are not present. Another common error is representing unicode characters with octals. Ensure dates are represented according to the chosen specification; bad dates may cause items to be rejected. Please always **follow the specs** and [validate](http://validator.w3.org/feed/) and everyone will win.
- The **Last-Modified** header should be returned in your server's response. Thunderbird will send this value in **If-Modified-Since** in its next request to your server, which you can respond to with code 304 if appropriate. This saves unnecessary bandwidth usage and processing if there are no new items or changes to your file.
- If you use Atom and its [threading extension](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4685.txt), Thunderbird will group related feed items (like comments to a post) into **threads** just like it does with related email messages.
- Changes to feed urls can be detected by Thunderbird and updated automatically for users. See [Bug 304917](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=304917) for two ways of doing this.
- New in Thunderbird 60: A **Publisher recommends:** update frequency is shown to the user in the Feed Subscriptions dialog if the relevant tags are included in your feed. Follow the [Syndication specification](http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/) to advertise your desired update frequency.

# Advanced Tips

- The feed update frequency in **Check for new articles** should be set to minimize unnecessary bandwidth usage and Thunderbird processing, if the publisher is not using **Last-Modified** above. If it is being used, an immediate **There are no new articles for this feed** message appears in the status bar when manually getting new messages for the folder twice quickly.
- A feed url may be added without being online; **adding in offline mode** will bypass feed validation. If offline (to go offline, click the status bar icon), a dialog will appear asking to go online for new messages. Cancel the prompt and the feed will be added. The feed's Title will be the url and may be edited. Once back online, Thunderbird may fail the feed for invalid url or syntax, but it will exist in the database.
- Display of a feed item summary or web page may be fine tuned by setting the following two prefs using the [Config Editor](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/config-editor"").  

rss.show.content-base  
Action on double click or enter in threadpane for a feed message:  
`0 - open web page in new window1 - open summary in new window2 - toggle load summary and web page in message pane3 - load web page in browser`

rss.message.loadWebPageOnSelect  
Additional action on feed message select:  
`0 - no action1 - load web page in default browser`
- New in Thunderbird 60: Users with very many feeds may choose to limit the number of feeds simultaneously being processed by setting the pref rss.max\_concurrent\_feeds in the [Config Editor](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/config-editor""). The default is 25.
- New in Thunderbird 60: Feed folders that contain a subscription url that is in error (server not reachable, feed file not found, certificate error, etc.) will be indicated with an icon. Open the Feed Subscriptions dialog, select the feed and focus the Feed URL, and click the Verify button to **check for network type problems**.
- Thunderbird has extensive logging of feed activity, viewable in Tools \> Developer Tools \> Error Console. Change the preference Feeds.logging.console to debug or trace (and restart) to see details of feed processing.

# Troubleshooting FAQ

**Q: Why are feed messages sometimes duplicated?**

A: Feed messages with identical content but different unique ids are not detected as duplicates. See [this post](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=13360829#p13360829) for many more details.

**Q: When viewing a feed web page, why does a browser sometimes open or a random page sometimes load in the browser?**

A: Since Thunderbird wasn't designed to be a web browser, it will send all link requests to your default browser. In this case, script on the feed web page is attempting to open a link. The best solution is to install the Adblock Plus extension. In addition to having extensive built in filters, Adblock Plus lets you configure custom urls or domains to be blocked. See also [Bug 524281](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524281).

**Q: Why can't I see some images or video or documents or other embedded content when viewing a feed summary?**

A: This is due to JavaScript being disabled for messages (emails, newsgroup posts, feed summaries). The request to implement a user configurable option to enable JavaScript, for feed summaries only, is [Bug 456481](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=456481).

# Check that your mail provider supports IMAP

While most mail providers support IMAP, a few still don't. So first make sure that your mail provider supports IMAP.

If your provider does not support IMAP and you still want to use an IMAP account, you must choose a new mail account provider (for instance, [those sponsored in Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new?title=new+email+address"" ""Page does not exist."") support IMAP), create an account, and then move your messages from your old POP account to your new IMAP account, as explained below.

# Disable your POP account

In order to avoid duplicating the checks for new messages, first go to your account settings by opening the ToolsEdit \> Account Settings menu, then select **Server settings** and un-check both **Check for new messages at startup** and **Check for new messages every XX minutes**.

# Create the IMAP account

1. Open the File \> New \> Existing account menu 
2. Set up your account with the help of [the assistant](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-account-configuration"").

# Configuring Chat

To use Chat, you must first create a new account (or configure an existing account) with an online instant messaging or chat provider. Thunderbird currently works with IRC, XMPP, Twitter, and Google Talk.

In this example we will show IRC, but the process is very similar for Twitter, Google Talk and XMPP.

## Start the New Account Wizard

At the top of the Thunderbird window, click on the File menu, then click New and then click Chat Account…:

![ChatSelectionDialog](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

## Enter Username

For IRC, you will have to enter your IRC server name, e.g. irc.mozilla.org for Mozilla's IRC server.

For XMPP, you will also have to enter your XMPP server name.

![irc-enter-username](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

## Enter Password

Enter the password for the service.

![irc-password](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

A password is optional for an IRC account and is only required if you have reserved your nickname on the IRC network.

## Advanced Options

This is not usually needed, so just click NextContinue.

![irc-skip-advanced-options](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

## Finish the Wizard

Next, you will be presented with a Summary screen. Click Finish to finish the wizard and start chatting.

![irc-summary](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

# Using Chat

## Connect to your Chat Account

First make sure that you are online by going to your Chat Status and connecting:

- click on the Tools menu and then click on Chat status and then Show Accounts…
- click on the Connect button next to the account you want to go online with

![irc-click-connect](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

## Use the Chat Tab to start and join conversations

Click on the Chat Tab next to the Write Tab to start and join conversations.

![irc-chat-tab](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

## Chat is included in Search

Like any other type of Thunderbird account (e.g. email and RSS), Chat is integrated with search.

Here's an example of email, Twitter and Chat conversations being found by Thunderbird's [global search](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/global-search""):

<h2 id=""w_changes-to-the-addressing-area-in-thunderbird-78"">Changes to the addressing area in Thunderbird 78</h2>
<p>Please note: The addressing area has been redesigned for Thunderbird 78, and this article has been fully rewritten to describe the new design and behaviour.
</p>
<ul><li> In Thunderbird 78, recipients of the same type (e.g. To, Cc, or Bcc) are grouped into a single row which will accept more than one email address. Handling message recipients is now easier and much more efficient than before. For example, you can now select several recipients and apply the same action to all of them at the same time (copy, cut, remove, drag etc.).
</li><li> By comparison, in Thunderbird 68, it was one recipient per address row, each with its own type selector. Recipients of different types could be wildly mixed, and acting on several recipients at the same time was not possible.
</li><li> You can find a short summary of differences and similarities between the old and new addressing area in the <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-78#w_new-addressing-area"">New Addressing Area</a> section of the article <a href=""/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-78"">New in Thunderbird 78.0</a>. However, the full details of the new design are described below.
</li></ul>
</div>
<h2 id=""w_adding-recipients-to-your-email-message"">Adding recipients to your email message</h2>
<p>Whenever you click Write, Forward or Reply, Thunderbird opens a new Write window, also known as compose window. It will open up with focus on the To: address field, ready for your input. A recipient consists of an email address and an optional display name which you can choose freely – but remember that your recipient will also see the display name! Typical email recipients look like this:
</p>
<dl><dt> service@example.com<br>
</dt><dt> Jane Doe &lt;jane.doe@example.com&gt;
</dt></dl>
<p>Thunderbird will show each recipient as a recipient item, sometimes jokingly called recipient “pill” by Thunderbird contributors because they first arrived with rounded corners (the recipient items, not the contributors… ;-)).
</p><p><br>
</p>
<h3 id=""w_adding-new-recipients"">Adding <em>new</em> recipients</h3>
<p>There are several ways of adding one or more new recipients to your message:
</p>
<ul><li> Type a recipient directly into the address field, then press <span class=""key"">Enter</span>. In the same line, just type another one and press <span class=""key"">Enter</span> again. Note: Do not enter any comma or semi-colon between recipient items, as Thunderbird will handle the technicalities for you.
</li><li> Copy and paste comma-separated recipients into the address field, then press <span class=""key"">Enter</span>. 
</li><li> Drag and drop recipients into a shown address field.
</li></ul>
<h3 id=""w_adding-recipients-from-your-address-book"">Adding recipients <em>from your address book</em></h3>
<p>Thunderbird offers very efficient possibilities of adding recipients which are already in your address book:
</p>
<ul><li> Type search words in the address field of your choice, and recipient autocomplete will assist you.
</li></ul>
<div class=""note"">
<dl><dt><strong>Autocomplete search</strong> is very powerful:
</dt></dl>
<dl><dt><ul><li> Order of search words doesn’t matter: “Doe John” finds “John Doe”.
</li><li> Partial search words work: “Ann” finds “Marianne”, “Mary-Ann” etc.
</li><li> You can even combine search words from different contact properties like name and email: “John example” finds “John Doe &lt;manager@example.com&gt;”.
</li><li> Comma is ignored, so “Doe, John” finds “John Richard Doe”.
</li><li> Try defining and searching unique nicknames for your contacts, too.
</li></ul>
</dt></dl>
</div>
<ul><li> <a href=""#w_selecting-and-adding-recipients-from-contacts-side-bar"">Add recipients from contacts sidebar</a>: A miniature address book right there in your write window! Powerful especially for adding several recipients.
</li><li> You can also <a href=""#w_starting-a-new-message-from-your-address-book"">start writing a message from contacts in your address book</a>.
</li></ul>
<div class=""note"">
<h3 id=""w_how-to-edit-or-remove-recipient-items"">How to edit or remove recipient items</h3>
<ul><li> To edit a recipient item, select it with mouse or cursor navigation keys, then press Enter. When you’re done editing, just press Enter again. More information about <a href=""#w_changing-recipient-type-how-to-move-recipients-to-another-address-field"">changing the type of a recipient item (To, Cc, and Bcc)</a>  below.

</p>
<ul><li> To remove a recipient item, select it and press <span class=""for"" data-for=""win,linux""><span class=""key"">Del</span> or <span class=""key"">Backspace</span></span><span class=""for"" data-for=""mac""><span class=""key"">Delete</span></span>.

</li></ul>
</div>
<h2 id=""w_address-fields-to-cc-bcc"">Address Fields: To, Cc, Bcc</h2>
<p>For efficient communication and privacy, Thunderbird offers different address fields to group your recipients by type:
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>To:</strong></td><td>The main recipients of your message (visible for all recipients).<br>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Cc (Carbon copy):</strong></td><td>Other recipients (visible for all recipients).<br>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Bcc (Blind carbon copy):</strong></td><td>Hidden recipients (not visible for all other recipients).<br>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Reply-To:</strong></td><td>You can specify one or more of your own email addresses where you want to receive replies to your message when the recipient uses the “Reply” function of his email system.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>To show the Cc: or Bcc: address fields, use the <span class=""button"">Cc</span> and <span class=""button"">Bcc</span> buttons on top of the To: address field; for Reply-To and other message headers, use the <span class=""button"">&gt;&gt;</span> disclosure button which says {tooltip Other types of addressing fields}.
</p><p><img alt=""TB78-Compose-Addressing-MoreAddressingFields"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2020-08-16-16-15-32-080bd0.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</p><p>It is recommended to use the Bcc: address field if you are writing to groups of people who are not related or very close friends. Any Bcc: recipient will receive the message, but all other recipients, even other Bcc: recipients, won’t know about that from looking at the message. If your message has only Bcc: recipients, the message will show as addressed to ""undisclosed recipients;"" or similar wording by the receiving email program. This will protect the privacy of your recipients, and prevent spam when lots of private email addresses might be made public by computers infected with computer viruses.
</p>
<div class=""note"">
<h3 id=""w_selecting-several-or-all-recipient-items"">Selecting several or all recipient items</h3>
<p>The new addressing area makes it easier than ever before to act on several recipient items at the same time. Just select and go! Clumsy was yesterday! Enjoy the new convenience of copying, cutting, pasting, moving, or deleting several recipient items in a single step. Depending on scenario, applying actions to lots of recipients is now up to 99% more efficient than before.

## Changes to the addressing area in Thunderbird 78

Please note: The addressing area has been redesigned for Thunderbird 78, and this article has been fully rewritten to describe the new design and behaviour.

- In Thunderbird 78, recipients of the same type (e.g. To, Cc, or Bcc) are grouped into a single row which will accept more than one email address. Handling message recipients is now easier and much more efficient than before. For example, you can now select several recipients and apply the same action to all of them at the same time (copy, cut, remove, drag etc.).
- By comparison, in Thunderbird 68, it was one recipient per address row, each with its own type selector. Recipients of different types could be wildly mixed, and acting on several recipients at the same time was not possible.
- You can find a short summary of differences and similarities between the old and new addressing area in the [New Addressing Area](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-78#w_new-addressing-area) section of the article [New in Thunderbird 78.0](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-78""). However, the full details of the new design are described below.

## Adding recipients to your email message

Whenever you click Write, Forward or Reply, Thunderbird opens a new Write window, also known as compose window. It will open up with focus on the To: address field, ready for your input. A recipient consists of an email address and an optional display name which you can choose freely – but remember that your recipient will also see the display name! Typical email recipients look like this:

<dl>
<dt> service@example.com<br>
</dt>
<dt> Jane Doe &lt;jane.doe@example.com&gt;
</dt>
</dl>

Thunderbird will show each recipient as a recipient item, sometimes jokingly called recipient “pill” by Thunderbird contributors because they first arrived with rounded corners (the recipient items, not the contributors…&nbsp;;-)).

### Adding _new_ recipients

There are several ways of adding one or more new recipients to your message:

- Type a recipient directly into the address field, then press Enter. In the same line, just type another one and press Enter again. Note: Do not enter any comma or semi-colon between recipient items, as Thunderbird will handle the technicalities for you.
- Copy and paste comma-separated recipients into the address field, then press Enter. 
- Drag and drop recipients into a shown address field.

### Adding recipients _from your address book_

Thunderbird offers very efficient possibilities of adding recipients which are already in your address book:

- Type search words in the address field of your choice, and recipient autocomplete will assist you.

<dl><dt>
<strong>Autocomplete search</strong> is very powerful:
</dt></dl><dl><dt>
<ul>
<li> Order of search words doesn’t matter: “Doe John” finds “John Doe”.
</li>
<li> Partial search words work: “Ann” finds “Marianne”, “Mary-Ann” etc.
</li>
<li> You can even combine search words from different contact properties like name and email: “John example” finds “John Doe &lt;manager@example.com&gt;”.
</li>
<li> Comma is ignored, so “Doe, John” finds “John Richard Doe”.
</li>
<li> Try defining and searching unique nicknames for your contacts, too.
</li>
</ul>
</dt></dl>

- You can also [start writing a message from contacts in your address book](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/addressing-email#w_starting-a-new-message-from-your-address-book).

### How to edit or remove recipient items

- To edit a recipient item, select it with mouse or cursor navigation keys, then press Enter. When you’re done editing, just press Enter again. More information about [changing the type of a recipient item (To, Cc, and Bcc)](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/addressing-email#w_changing-recipient-type-how-to-move-recipients-to-another-address-field) below.

![TB78-Compose-Addressing-EditPill](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

- To remove a recipient item, select it and press Del or BackspaceDelete. In the same way, you can also [select several recipient items](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/addressing-email#w_selecting-several-or-all-recipient-items) and delete them in a single step. Delete is also available from the context menu after right-clicking on a recipient item or pressing the context menu key.

## Address Fields: To, Cc, Bcc

For efficient communication and privacy, Thunderbird offers different address fields to group your recipients by type:

| **To:** | The main recipients of your message (visible for all recipients).  
 |
| **Cc&nbsp;(Carbon&nbsp;copy):** | Other recipients (visible for all recipients).  
 |
| **Bcc&nbsp;(Blind&nbsp;carbon&nbsp;copy):** | Hidden recipients (not visible for all other recipients).  
 |
| **Reply-To:** | You can specify one or more of your own email addresses where you want to receive replies to your message when the recipient uses the “Reply” function of his email system. |

To show the Cc: or Bcc: address fields, use the Cc and Bcc buttons on top of the To: address field; for Reply-To and other message headers, use the \>\> disclosure button which says {tooltip Other types of addressing fields}.

![TB78-Compose-Addressing-MoreAddressingFields](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

It is recommended to use the Bcc: address field if you are writing to groups of people who are not related or very close friends. Any Bcc: recipient will receive the message, but all other recipients, even other Bcc: recipients, won’t know about that from looking at the message. If your message has only Bcc: recipients, the message will show as addressed to ""undisclosed recipients;"" or similar wording by the receiving email program. This will protect the privacy of your recipients, and prevent spam when lots of private email addresses might be made public by computers infected with computer viruses.

### Selecting several or all recipient items

The new addressing area makes it easier than ever before to act on several recipient items at the same time. Just select and go! Clumsy was yesterday! Enjoy the new convenience of copying, cutting, pasting, moving, or deleting several recipient items in a single step. Depending on scenario, applying actions to lots of recipients is now up to 99% more efficient than before.

- _To select several recipient items even when they are <u>not</u> next to each other:_ Hold down the CtrlCommand key while clicking on each recipient. Using keyboard, hold down CtrlCommand while navigating with →, ←, Home or End, and select recipient items with Space. You can even select recipient items from different address fields this way!

### Changing recipient type: How to move recipients to another address field

You can now change the type of your recipients between To, Cc, and Bcc in a snap, even for several recipients at the same time. First, [select the recipient items](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/addressing-email#w_selecting-several-or-all-recipient-items) which you want to move to another address field. Now there are several ways of moving the selected recipient items to another address field:

- Right-click on a selected recipient item (or press the context menu key), then choose Add to Cc, Add to Bcc, or Add to To from the context menu. The target address field will be automatically shown if it is still hidden, saving you an extra step.
- Alternatively, press CtrlCommand+X to cut the selected recipient items, focus the target address field, and paste them with CtrlCommand+V.
- Drag and drop selected recipient items between shown address fields, or onto the recipient field button of a hidden field (Cc, Bcc), which will automatically be shown with the recipients added.

## Selecting and adding recipients from Contacts Side bar

The Write window offers a miniature address book pane called “Contacts Sidebar”. This is convenient and powerful especially for adding several recipients based on your search words. Select a specific address book to display only the contacts contained therein. You can show or hide this pane with the shortcut key F9 or using the menu: View \> Toolbars \> Contacts Sidebar.

![TB78-Compose-ContactsSideBar](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

To add a single contact to the To: address field, simply double-click on it. There are several ways of selecting several contacts in contacts sidebar in order to add them as recipients.

### Selecting several contacts from your address book

- _To select several contacts which are <u>not</u> next to each other:_ Hold down the CtrlCommand key while you click on each contact (or press spacebar on keyboard). Clicking or pressing spacebar on an already selected contact will deselect it.
<dl><dt>
<img alt=""TB78-Compose-ContactsSideBar-CtrlSelect"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2020-08-16-16-02-01-9fa88c.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>
- _To select several contacts which are next to each other:_ Click on the first contact you want to select, then hold down Shift key while clicking on the last contact, which will also select all contacts in between. Alternatively, using keyboard, hold down the Shift key while using navigation keys like ↓, ↑, End, Home, Page Up or Page Down to extend your selection.
<dl><dt>

</dt></dl>
- _For advanced high efficiency selections, you can actually combine the two methods:_ Keep holding down CtrlCommand and add Shift when appropriate to add a coherent group of contacts to your existing distributed selection.

### Adding contacts from contacts sidebar to an address field

Here’s how you can add one or more selected contacts to the desired address field:

- Use the Add to To:, Add to Cc:, Add to Bcc: buttons at the bottom of the pane.
- Alternatively, right-click on one of the selected contacts and add them using the respective action from context menu.

## Starting a new message from your Address Book

It is also possible to start writing a new message directly from the Address Book window. This might be handy for the simple scenario where you only want to use the To: address field. The address book has the same search and [selection](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/addressing-email#w_selecting-several-contacts-from-your-address-book) features like contacts sidebar. So you can select several contacts by holding down the Ctrl key and/or the Shift key. Then just click the Write button on the Address Book Toolbar or right-click on the selection and choose Write from context menu.

<p>Remote content are parts of a message (such as images, stylesheets, or videos) which are not included in the message itself, but are downloaded from the Internet when you view the message.
</p><p>Remote content is a privacy concern because it allows the message sender to know:

</li><li> that your email address is actually used (""active"")
</li></ul>
<p>This is almost the same information websites commonly collect about you during normal web surfing. While browsing has the same privacy implications, what makes remote content in messages different is that it is targeted at you initially, so you can assume your access is directly linkable to your email address. This is also why spam often contains remote images (also known as ""web bugs"") which allow the spammer to mark your address as valid if the image is ever loaded.

# What is remote content and why is it blocked?

Remote content are parts of a message (such as images, stylesheets, or videos) which are not included in the message itself, but are downloaded from the Internet when you view the message.

Remote content is a privacy concern because it allows the message sender to know:

- each time you view the message

# How does Thunderbird protect my privacy?

By default, Thunderbird blocks, and does not download, remote content so that the sender does not get any information about you. Instead, it displays a notification bar with the message **To protect your privacy, Thunderbird has blocked remote content in this message**.

# Create email using a mailing list

There are two methods producing different results.

## **Via the Address Book**

On the Mail Toolbar, locate 'Address Book'.

1. Click Address Book to open it.
2. Select the mailing list.
3. Click the Write button.

This will open a new Write message window, and each contact in the mailing list will appear in a separate To field. This allows you to remove a name, if desired.   
You may also need to manually select Bcc for each email address, as your contacts may not want you to distribute their email address.  
Enter the Subject; Compose the email and click Send.

3. Select the mailing list.
4. Click the Add to Bcc button or another option.

![Mailing Lists](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

This will add the mailing list as the mailing list name. You cannot see individual contacts. This saves you from needing to change eg. To to Bcc, but you cannot edit any names from that email using this method.  
Enter the Subject; Compose the email and click Send.

# How to add two contacts who use the same email address

As an example:   
In your address book you have two people with the same email address.   
a) Bob Smith has email address: thesmiths @ domain.   
b) Jan Smith has email address: thesmiths @ domain.

These two people are perfectly OK in an address book, but to get them into a mailing list will not work using the conventional method. So do the following to get them into the mailing list.

In the Address Book, select one of the people and edit their email address. In the example I put a letter A in the front.   
Jan Smith has the email address Athesmiths @ domain.

Now move both people to the mailing list. As the email addresses are not the same, they will both move to the mailing list. Once in the mailing list, select the mailing list and double click Jan Smith to edit the email address by removing the 'A'. Click OK when finished.

Now you should have two people sharing the same email address in the mailing list, and if you go back and check the address Book entries, you will find them correct.

# The ideal case

In an ideal world, all the add-ons you would want are officially vetted, approved, and can be found on the official website, [addons.thunderbird.net](https://addons.thunderbird.net/).

For add-ons that fall into this category, you can simply go to the Add-ons Manager tab in Thunderbird by clicking the menu button ![Fx57Menu](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) followed by Add-ons and click on the Extensions panel on the left to display the search box in the top-right corner.

Once you have done your first search, a new Search category appears in the panel on the left. You can keep refining your search until you find what you want.

Here is a search for add-ons that mention ""Contacts"":

![Addon tab](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

Once you locate an add-on you like, click on Install, wait for it to be downloaded, then click on _Restart now_ if prompted.

# A slightly less ideal case (Install from a downloaded XPI file)

You may have been given an URL for the add-on, or the add-on you want isn't on the ""official"" page. Searching for it, as shown above, doesn't locate the add-on.

Visit the webpage in your browser, right-click the download link with your mouse, select Save Link As… and save the XPI file to a location on your computer that is easy to remember. As the download is temporary, it is suggested you use either your Downloads folder or your desktop.

If you are using older versions of Firefox, a left-click on the download link will cause the browser to try and install the add-on into Firefox itself. This invariably results in an error about compatibility, as the add-on is designed for Thunderbird. If you're using another browser, a left-click might result in your browser attempting to download and ""open"" the XPI file. This is basically a small program, so it is not meant to be opened. It has to be saved to disk.

To install a downloaded XPI file into Thunderbird, you have two options.

## Download

Right-click the link and select Save As… or Save Link As… as described earlier.

You will be invited to download and save the file. Most browsers have a default download location. Make a note of where it downloads to, and what it's called. Some add-on files may have silly names like ""latest-234.xpi"", which is not very helpful when you're trying to find it later on.

Open the Add-ons Manager tab in Thunderbird. There's a button to the left of the search box. ![CogWheel](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) ![CogWheelLinux](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) Click this and select Install Add-on From File… from the subsequent menu.

![MenuUnderCogWheel](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

You will need to navigate to where you saved the XPI file using the file picker and select it to complete the install.

## Drag-and-drop

- Open the add-ons manager (click the menu button ![Fx57Menu](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and then Add-ons).
- Drag your downloaded XPI file to the Add-ons Manager tab and drop it.

If you are using Windows, you can even skip the desktop bit. Open your browser and Thunderbird side by side, with Thunderbird's Add-ons Manager tab displayed. Drag the link directly from the browser onto Thunderbird's Add-ons Manager tab. The main advantage of this method is that you don't need to actually save a copy of the add-on to your hard disk before it is installed.

27077,Maildir in Thunderbird,maildir-thunderbird,https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird,en-US,"Optional support for Maildir allows you to store email as individual files, unlike the default single file format. Learn about Maildir in Thunderbird.","<p>Optional support for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir"">Maildir</a> allows a single unique file per email  (using the <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000388.shtml"">EML</a> data format), unlike the default monolithic single file format of one file per folder known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox"">mbox</a>. <strong>Note – this is NOT full Maildir in the sense that most users, particularly Linux or mail administrators, know Maildir. You cannot point Thunderbird accounts to a mail server directory, nor do you get message flags stored with emails.</strong> See the <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/Maildir"">wiki</a> for more details.
</p><p>Maildir is disabled by default because there are <u><a href=""http://mzl.la/1HTGlUw"">still many bugs</a></u>. It is not 100% ready for users. 
</p>
<div class=""warning""><strong>Warning:</strong> We suggest you leave Maildir disabled unless you are an advanced user, willing to risk your data, and know how to back up your email before turning on Maildir and how to restore it if you run into problems.</div>
<p>The remainder of this article explains the format change and how to test Maildir.
</p><p>Maildir is a major change for Thunderbird because it changes the mail storage mechanism.  The single file per email storage format has significant benefits:
</p>
<ul><li> Backups are easier and shorter because the amount of data to be backed up is reduced to only emails that have changed since the last backup.
</li><li> It is easier for anti-virus to scan emails in individual files, and infected mails can be removed without the loss of all the other mail in the folder, as often occurs today with anti-virus software which cannot handle multiple emails in one file.
</li></ul>
<h1 id=""w_how-to-turn-on-maildir"">How to turn on Maildir</h1>
<div class=""warning""><strong>Warning:</strong> Again, this feature is experimental and we recommend that you know how to file bugs and how to back up and restore your email before turning on Maildir.</div>
<p>To turn on Maildir:

</p>",thunderbird,learn-basics-get-started;set-up-email-thunderbird;emails-thunderbird,"Optional support for [Maildir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir) allows a single unique file per email (using the [EML](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000388.shtml) data format), unlike the default monolithic single file format of one file per folder known as [mbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox). **Note – this is NOT full Maildir in the sense that most users, particularly Linux or mail administrators, know Maildir. You cannot point Thunderbird accounts to a mail server directory, nor do you get message flags stored with emails.** See the [wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/Maildir) for more details.

Maildir is disabled by default because there are <u><a href=""http://mzl.la/1HTGlUw"">still many bugs</a></u>. It is not 100% ready for users.

**Warning:** We suggest you leave Maildir disabled unless you are an advanced user, willing to risk your data, and know how to back up your email before turning on Maildir and how to restore it if you run into problems.

The remainder of this article explains the format change and how to test Maildir.

Maildir is a major change for Thunderbird because it changes the mail storage mechanism. The single file per email storage format has significant benefits:

- Backups are easier and shorter because the amount of data to be backed up is reduced to only emails that have changed since the last backup.
- It is easier for anti-virus to scan emails in individual files, and infected mails can be removed without the loss of all the other mail in the folder, as often occurs today with anti-virus software which cannot handle multiple emails in one file.

# How to turn on Maildir

**Warning:** Again, this feature is experimental and we recommend that you know how to file bugs and how to back up and restore your email before turning on Maildir.

To turn on Maildir:

1. Back up your email.
2. In the menu bar, click the Thunderbird menu and select Settings.Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) and choose Settings.
3. Select the Advanced panel, followed by the General tab.
4. Next to **Message Store Type for new accounts** , select File per message (maildir).

Any email account created from now on will use Maildir. Existing accounts will continue to use mbox. If you want to use mbox again for new accounts, just reset the config variable.

To change an existing account to use maildir, see [this blog post](https://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/thunderbird-from-mbox-to-maildir.389599/).

**Please [file a bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Thunderbird) if you encounter any Maildir issues.** See also [already filed bug reports](http://mzl.la/1HTGlUw).

To  work around this issue, a two-step process is necessary to install the latest version of Thunderbird. Windows XP and Vista users should follow these steps:
</p>
<ol><li> <a href=""/en-US/kb/installing-thunderbird-windows"">Download and install Thunderbird</a> up to version 38.5.0 (<a href=""https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/38.5.0/"">link to download</a>).

</li></ol>
<p>We're sorry for the inconvenience.
</p>
<div class=""note""><strong>For advanced users:</strong><br>

</div>",thunderbird,install-migrate-and-update;download-install-and-migration;how,"Although Thunderbird will run on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or above, the latest installers for Thunderbird require Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3) or Windows Vista with update [KB2763674](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2763674). To work around this issue, a two-step process is necessary to install the latest version of Thunderbird. Windows XP and Vista users should follow these steps:

1. [Download and install Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-thunderbird-windows"") up to version 38.5.0 ([link to download](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/38.5.0/)). 
2. After installing this version you can use the Thunderbird updater to install the latest version of Thunderbird. See the article [Updating Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/updating-thunderbird"") for details.

We're sorry for the inconvenience.

**For advanced users:**  

On Windows XP SP3 or up-to-date Vista operating systems, you can download the full installer for the latest version of Thunderbird from [https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/)

For example, to download the Thunderbird 38.6.0 Windows English (US) full installer, navigate to /38.6.0/win32/en-US/ and choose the file Thunderbird Setup 38.6.0.exe.

Before downloading, read the [System Requirements](https://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird/system-requirements) and see the [Release Notes](https://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird/notes) for information about the latest Thunderbird release.

</p>
<ul><li> <strong>When sending messages, always request a return receipt</strong>: Check mark this setting to make Thunderbird automatically request a return receipt on every message you send.
</li></ul>
<p>When receipt arrives:
</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Leave it in my Inbox</strong>: Return receipts arrive through email. Select this <span class=""for"" data-for=""win"">option</span><span class=""for"" data-for=""mac,linux"">preference</span> to leave return receipts in your Inbox email folder.
</li><li> <strong>Move it to my ""Sent"" folder</strong>: Select this <span class=""for"" data-for=""win"">option</span><span class=""for"" data-for=""mac,linux"">preference</span> to make Thunderbird automatically move return receipts to your ""Sent"" email folder.
</li></ul>
<p>When I receive a request for a return receipt:
</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Never send a return receipt</strong>: If someone sends you a message that contains a request for a return receipt, select this <span class=""for"" data-for=""win"">option</span><span class=""for"" data-for=""mac,linux"">preference</span> to make Thunderbird always ignore the request. 
</li><li> <strong>Allow return receipts for some messages</strong>: For each of these cases, you can set Thunderbird to always send a receipt, ignore the request, or choose <strong>Ask me</strong>, which will make Thunderbird display a prompt when you open the message.
</li></ul>
<h2 id=""w_scrolling"">Scrolling</h2>
<ul><li> <strong>Use autoscrolling</strong>: Autoscrolling is a useful feature which allows you to scroll by clicking the middle mouse button (usually the scroll wheel) and moving the mouse up or down. Some people find this annoying, so autoscrolling can be disabled with this <span class=""for"" data-for=""win"">option</span><span class=""for"" data-for=""mac,linux"">preference</span>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <strong>Use smooth scrolling</strong>: Smooth scrolling can be very useful if you read a lot of long messages. Normally, when you press <span class=""key"">Page Down</span>, the view jumps directly down one page. With smooth scrolling, it slides down smoothly, so you can see how much it scrolls. This makes it easier to resume reading from where you were before.
</li></ul>
<h2 id=""w_system-integration"">System Integration</h2>
<ul><li> <strong>Always check to see if Thunderbird is the default mail client on startup</strong>: Select this setting if you want Thunderbird to check whether it is the default mail client at startup. Making Thunderbird your default mail client will ensure Thunderbird is used whenever an application has the option to send mail. For more information, see <a href=""/en-US/kb/make-thunderbird-default-mail-client"">Make Thunderbird the Default Mail Client</a>.
</li></ul>
<div class=""for"" data-for=""win"">
<ul><li> <strong>Allow Windows Search to search messages</strong>: Select this option to allow Windows' built-in search to index your Thunderbird messages. Once indexed, your Thunderbird messages will be included in search results when you use the Windows Search feature.
</li></ul>
</div><div class=""for"" data-for=""mac"">
<ul><li> <strong>Allow Spotlight to search messages</strong>: Select this preference to allow Spotlight to index your Thunderbird messages. Once indexed, your Thunderbird messages will be included in Spotlight search results.
</li></ul>
</div>
<h2 id=""w_advanced-configuration"">Advanced Configuration</h2>
<ul><li> <strong>Enable Global Search and Indexer</strong>: This enables Thunderbird's built-in search feature, which allows you to search among all messages you have in Thunderbird. For more information, see <a href=""/en-US/kb/global-search"">Global Search</a>.
</li><li> <strong>Message Store Type for new accounts</strong>: By default, Thunderbird stores mail folders locally in single files (For example, there's a file called <em>Inbox</em>). You can make new accounts store each message in its own file. For more information, see <a href=""/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird"">Maildir in Thunderbird</a>.
</li><li><strong>Use hardware acceleration when available</strong>: Thunderbird can use your computer's graphics processor to display some messages with video and animation. This makes Thunderbird faster since your computer's graphics processor is much better than your computer's main processor at displaying these types of things. This box is checked by default but the feature isn't available for all graphics processors. Thunderbird will enable it when possible.<div class=""note"">If you change this setting you must restart Thunderbird.</div>
</li><li> <strong>Config Editor</strong>: The Config Editor lists all <span class=""for"" data-for=""win"">options</span><span class=""for"" data-for=""mac,linux"">preferences</span> that Thunderbird has loaded. Many of them are advanced <span class=""for"" data-for=""win"">options</span><span class=""for"" data-for=""mac,linux"">preferences</span>, that are not available in the <span class=""for"" data-for=""win"">Options</span><span class=""for"" data-for=""mac,linux"">Preferences</span> window or Account Settings window.

<h2 id=""w_connection"">Connection</h2>
<p>Your organization or Internet service provider may offer or require you to use a proxy. A proxy acts as an intermediary between your computer and the Internet. It intercepts all requests to the Internet to see if it can fulfill the request using its cache. Proxies are used to improve performance, filter requests, and hide your computer from the Internet to improve security. Proxies are often part of corporate firewalls.

<h2 id=""w_offline"">Offline</h2>
<p>These settings control how Thunderbird behaves when your computer is not connected to the internet.

<ul><li> <strong>Automatically follow detected online state</strong>: Thunderbird will check if your computer is not connected to the internet. If it is not connected, Thunderbird will switch to offline mode. When a connection is detected, Thunderbird will switch to online mode.
</li><li> <strong>Manual state when starting up</strong>: If <em>Automatically follow detected online state</em> is not enabled, this will determine how Thunderbird decides if it should be in offline mode when you start it. Setting this to <em>Offline</em> will make Thunderbird always start in offline mode. Setting this to <em>Online</em> will make Thunderbird always start in online mode. <em>Ask me for online state</em> will make Thunderbird always prompt you which mode to choose.  <em>Remember previous online state</em> will make Thunderbird open in the mode it was set at when you last closed it.
</li><li> <strong>Send unsent messages when going online</strong>: If you have any messages in your Outbox, setting this to <em>Yes</em> will make Thunderbird automatically send those messages when you switch to online mode. When set to <em>No</em>, messages in your Outbox will not be sent. Setting this to <em>Ask me</em> will make Thunderbird prompt you to send messages in your Outbox when you switch to online mode.
</li><li> <strong>Download messages for offline use when going offline</strong>: If you have any offline folders set to keep a copy of every message on your computer, setting this to <em>Yes</em> will make Thunderbird automatically download any messages in those folders you don't have stored locally when you switch to offline mode. When set to <em>No</em>, local copies of messages will not be synced. Setting this to <em>Ask me</em> will make Thunderbird prompt you to download new messages from online folders when you switch to offline mode.
</li></ul>
<h2 id=""w_disk-space"">Disk space</h2>
<p>Messages you view, which are not kept on your computer, are normally stored in a special cache folder for quicker viewing the next time you view the message. You can specify the amount of disk space the cache can use here. You can also immediately clear the contents of the cache.
</p>
<ul><li> <span class=""button"">Clear Now</span>: Immediately clears the current contents of the cache, freeing the disk space used by the cache.
</li><li> <strong>Use up to ___MB of space for the cache</strong>: This box allows you to specify the maximum size, in megabytes, of the cache on your computer.
</li><li> <strong>Compact all folders when it will save over ___MB in total</strong>: When a message is deleted, Thunderbird will keep it stored, and mark it as deleted so you won't see it. Compacting a folder removes any messages from storage that have been marked as deleted. This will make message lists load faster, and take up less disk space. Checking this box allows you to specify the maximum size, in megabytes, of the folder before Thunderbird will automatically compact it.

## Return Receipts

A return receipt adds a request with your message to notify you when the recipient has opened the message.

## Return Receipts Dialog

![tb45-advanced-general-rr-win10](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) ![tb45-advanced-general-rr-mac](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) ![tb45-advanced-general-rr-linux](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

- **When sending messages, always request a return receipt** : Check mark this setting to make Thunderbird automatically request a return receipt on every message you send.

When receipt arrives:

- **Leave it in my Inbox** : Return receipts arrive through email. Select this optionpreference to leave return receipts in your Inbox email folder.
- **Move it to my ""Sent"" folder** : Select this optionpreference to make Thunderbird automatically move return receipts to your ""Sent"" email folder.

When I receive a request for a return receipt:

- **Never send a return receipt** : If someone sends you a message that contains a request for a return receipt, select this optionpreference to make Thunderbird always ignore the request. 
- **Allow return receipts for some messages** : For each of these cases, you can set Thunderbird to always send a receipt, ignore the request, or choose **Ask me** , which will make Thunderbird display a prompt when you open the message.

## Scrolling

- **Use autoscrolling** : Autoscrolling is a useful feature which allows you to scroll by clicking the middle mouse button (usually the scroll wheel) and moving the mouse up or down. Some people find this annoying, so autoscrolling can be disabled with this optionpreference.

- **Use smooth scrolling** : Smooth scrolling can be very useful if you read a lot of long messages. Normally, when you press Page Down, the view jumps directly down one page. With smooth scrolling, it slides down smoothly, so you can see how much it scrolls. This makes it easier to resume reading from where you were before.

## System Integration

- **Always check to see if Thunderbird is the default mail client on startup** : Select this setting if you want Thunderbird to check whether it is the default mail client at startup. Making Thunderbird your default mail client will ensure Thunderbird is used whenever an application has the option to send mail. For more information, see [Make Thunderbird the Default Mail Client](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/make-thunderbird-default-mail-client"").

- **Allow Windows Search to search messages** : Select this option to allow Windows' built-in search to index your Thunderbird messages. Once indexed, your Thunderbird messages will be included in search results when you use the Windows Search feature.

- **Allow Spotlight to search messages** : Select this preference to allow Spotlight to index your Thunderbird messages. Once indexed, your Thunderbird messages will be included in Spotlight search results.

## Advanced Configuration

- **Enable Global Search and Indexer** : This enables Thunderbird's built-in search feature, which allows you to search among all messages you have in Thunderbird. For more information, see [Global Search](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/global-search"").
- **Message Store Type for new accounts** : By default, Thunderbird stores mail folders locally in single files (For example, there's a file called _Inbox_). You can make new accounts store each message in its own file. For more information, see [Maildir in Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird"").
- **Use hardware acceleration when available** : Thunderbird can use your computer's graphics processor to display some messages with video and animation. This makes Thunderbird faster since your computer's graphics processor is much better than your computer's main processor at displaying these types of things. This box is checked by default but the feature isn't available for all graphics processors. Thunderbird will enable it when possible.
If you change this setting you must restart Thunderbird.
- **Config Editor** : The Config Editor lists all optionspreferences that Thunderbird has loaded. Many of them are advanced optionspreferences, that are not available in the OptionsPreferences window or Account Settings window. In the Config Editor, you can view, edit, and reset those optionspreferences. For more information, see [Config Editor](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/config-editor"").

## Telemetry

- **Enable Telemetry** : Enabling this setting will send anonymous data ([learn more](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/share-data-mozilla-help-improve-firefox"")) to Mozilla about the real world performance of Thunderbird. This information will be used to make Thunderbird better.

## Crash Reporter

- **Enable Crash Reporter** : If Thunderbird crashes, the [Mozilla Crash Reporter](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/mozilla-crash-reporter-tb"") will appear, asking you if you want to report the crash to Mozilla. With this box check marked, the _Tell Mozilla about this crash so they can fix it_ check box in the crash reporter will default to being check marked.

## Connection

Your organization or Internet service provider may offer or require you to use a proxy. A proxy acts as an intermediary between your computer and the Internet. It intercepts all requests to the Internet to see if it can fulfill the request using its cache. Proxies are used to improve performance, filter requests, and hide your computer from the Internet to improve security. Proxies are often part of corporate firewalls.

- **No proxy** : Choose this if you don't want to use a proxy.
- **Auto-detect proxy settings for this network** : Choose this if you want Thunderbird to automatically detect the proxy settings for your network.
- **Use system proxy settings** : Choose this if you want to use the proxy settings configured for your operating system. _(default setting)_
- **Manual proxy configuration** : Choose this if you have a list of one or more proxy servers. Ask your system administrator for the configuration information. Each proxy requires a hostname and a port number.
  - If the same proxy name and port number are used for all protocols, check **Use this proxy server for all protocols**.
  - **No Proxy For** : List of hostnames or IP addresses that will not be proxied.
- **Automatic proxy configuration URL** : Choose this if you have a [proxy configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config) (.pac) file. Enter the URL and click OK to save changes and load the proxy configuration.
  - Reload: The reload button will load the currently available proxy configuration.

## Offline

These settings control how Thunderbird behaves when your computer is not connected to the internet. For example, Thunderbird will not check for new messages, or try to download messages when you select them. When composing a message, the Send button will become ""Send Later"" and Thunderbird will put your outgoing message in the Outbox, instead of trying to send it.

## Offline Settings Dialog

![tb45-advanced-network-offline-win10](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) ![tb45-advanced-network-offline-mac](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) ![tb45-advanced-network-offline-linux](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

- **Automatically follow detected online state** : Thunderbird will check if your computer is not connected to the internet. If it is not connected, Thunderbird will switch to offline mode. When a connection is detected, Thunderbird will switch to online mode.
- **Manual state when starting up** : If _Automatically follow detected online state_ is not enabled, this will determine how Thunderbird decides if it should be in offline mode when you start it. Setting this to _Offline_ will make Thunderbird always start in offline mode. Setting this to _Online_ will make Thunderbird always start in online mode. _Ask me for online state_ will make Thunderbird always prompt you which mode to choose. _Remember previous online state_ will make Thunderbird open in the mode it was set at when you last closed it.
- **Send unsent messages when going online** : If you have any messages in your Outbox, setting this to _Yes_ will make Thunderbird automatically send those messages when you switch to online mode. When set to _No_, messages in your Outbox will not be sent. Setting this to _Ask me_ will make Thunderbird prompt you to send messages in your Outbox when you switch to online mode.
- **Download messages for offline use when going offline** : If you have any offline folders set to keep a copy of every message on your computer, setting this to _Yes_ will make Thunderbird automatically download any messages in those folders you don't have stored locally when you switch to offline mode. When set to _No_, local copies of messages will not be synced. Setting this to _Ask me_ will make Thunderbird prompt you to download new messages from online folders when you switch to offline mode.

## Disk space

Messages you view, which are not kept on your computer, are normally stored in a special cache folder for quicker viewing the next time you view the message. You can specify the amount of disk space the cache can use here. You can also immediately clear the contents of the cache.

- Clear Now: Immediately clears the current contents of the cache, freeing the disk space used by the cache.
- **Use up to \_\_\_MB of space for the cache** : This box allows you to specify the maximum size, in megabytes, of the cache on your computer.
- **Compact all folders when it will save over \_\_\_MB in total** : When a message is deleted, Thunderbird will keep it stored, and mark it as deleted so you won't see it. Compacting a folder removes any messages from storage that have been marked as deleted. This will make message lists load faster, and take up less disk space. Checking this box allows you to specify the maximum size, in megabytes, of the folder before Thunderbird will automatically compact it.

- To review the history of updates that have been downloaded and installed, click Show Update History.
- **Use a background service to install updates:** Thunderbird will use the [Mozilla Maintenance Service](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-mozilla-maintenance-service"") when installing updates. This will remove the need to authorize Thunderbird to make changes to your computer through the User Account Control dialog in Windows 7 and Vista.

[Certificates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) help perform encryption and decryption of connections to websites.

- **When a server requests my personal certificate:** Some servers ask you to identify yourself with a personal certificate. In order to do so, they ask Thunderbird to generate one for you. When you access a server in the future, Thunderbird will ask you for which certificate to use. If you wish to have Thunderbird automatically choose a certificate for you, select the **Select one automatically** optionpreference. 
**Note:** A personal certificate can contain personally identifiable information, such as your name or address. It may therefore harm your privacy if you select the **Select one automatically** optionpreference. If you do, you will not be alerted when a website request your personal certificate, and you may lose the ability to control who can access your personal information.

- **Query OCSP responder servers to confirm the current validity of certificates** : Thunderbird may ask an OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) server to confirm that a certificate is still valid. By default, Thunderbird validates a certificate if the certificate provides an OCSP server. You will most likely only need to change this if your Internet environment requires it.

- Manage Certificates: Click this button to view stored certificates, import new certificates, and back up or delete old certificates in Thunderbird.

- **Allow antivirus clients to quarantine individual incoming messages** : By default, Thunderbird stores each mail folder locally as single file. For example, there's a file called Inbox. If your antivirus software detects a virus in a new incoming message, it will quarantine the entire inbox file because the new message has been saved to that file. 

But with this setting enabled, Thunderbird first stores each incoming message in a temporary file in the system temp folder on your computer, allowing your antivirus software to only quarantine a single message. If the file is removed by the antivirus, then you get an error message about the file being missing. If the new message file still exists after being scanned by antivirus software, then it is moved to your Thunderbird inbox folder file.

<p>If you are using a Thunderbird package distributed from the Thunderbird website, this section does not apply to you and you should use the section above.
</p><p>Some Linux distributions do not bundle Lightning with Thunderbird, Ubuntu for example. So you had Lightning installed either from a package of your distribution or from <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net"">ATN</a>.
</p><p>If the former, please consult your distribution for a compatible package. In case of ATN, it may happen that Linux distributions ship Thunderbird updates before a Lightning version compatible to that Thunderbird version became available at ATN. This will result in an incompatible Lightning, and broken calendar functionality.
</p><p>If you are affected, you can switch to a compatible Lightning (or Provider for Google) package if available from your distribution.
</p><p>Ubuntu:
</p>
<ol><li>Open Thunderbird add-ons manager
</li><li>Delete Lightning extension
</li><li>Install package: xul-ext-lightning: sudo apt install xul-ext-lightning

<p>If the above doesn't work for you, please consult your distribution's documentation for the exact package name or the commands needed for step 3.

<p>This was related to a cross update from a bundled version to a version from <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net"">ATN</a> (formerly <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org"">AMO</a>) add-ons distribution platform. This is resolved starting with Thunderbird 60.2.1. If you use a prior version and encounter this issue, please either update or reset the first day in a week to your needs:

<p>If you are downloading a newer Thunderbird version instead of waiting for the automatic update or e.g. you want to test something in a beta version and you don't want to setup everything from scratch, you could use a previously used user profile. When doing so, the Lightning version should be updated when starting the Thunderbird with that profile. If it doesn't, then resetting will help - this doesn't affect your calendar data.
</p>
<ol><li> Start Thunderbird with the selected user profile
</li><li> Go to the <span class=""menu"">Advanced</span> section of Thunderbird Settings
 and click on <span class=""button"">Config Editor...</span>

</li><li> Restart Thunderbird
</li></ol>
<p>N.B.: if you do this e.g. for testing a beta version, and you want to continue to use that copy of the <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"">profile</a> on a previous version of Thunderbird afterwards, you will have to do the same procedure on that Thunderbird version again, since downgrades always trigger this behavior. Therefore for beta testing it is recommended to <a href=""/en-US/kb/using-multiple-profiles"">use a separate (copy of the) user profile</a>.
</p>

<p>If you are using Thunderbird Daily, do not install Lightning using the add-ons manager.
</p><p>The best version of the add-on is distributed automatically on the nightly update channel. So if you install using the add-ons manager it will cause the best version that was bundled to not be used.  
</p><p>If you think you are affected, you can check and fix it easily:
</p>
<ol><li> Open the Thunderbird add-ons manager
</li><li> Switch to the <span class=""menu"">Extensions</span> list
</li><li> If the Lightning item in the list has an <span class=""button"">Remove</span> option, you have over-installed it (for any other addon this would be expected and doesn't require any action since doing the same would completely remove them)
</li></ol>
<p>To correct it just:
</p>
<ol><li> Press <span class=""button"">Remove</span> for Lightning if present

4. Close the editor, leave the Thunderbird options, open Thunderbird's add-ons manager and switch to the list of installed extensions
5. If Lightning is listed there, click on Remove to the right of the list item
6. Restart Thunderbird

After Thunderbird has been relaunched, Lightning will be back and you will have access to your calendar data.

# I am on Linux and Lightning disappeared after Thunderbird got updated (release and beta channel)

If you are using a Thunderbird package distributed from the Thunderbird website, this section does not apply to you and you should use the section above.

Some Linux distributions do not bundle Lightning with Thunderbird, Ubuntu for example. So you had Lightning installed either from a package of your distribution or from [ATN](https://addons.thunderbird.net).

If the former, please consult your distribution for a compatible package. In case of ATN, it may happen that Linux distributions ship Thunderbird updates before a Lightning version compatible to that Thunderbird version became available at ATN. This will result in an incompatible Lightning, and broken calendar functionality.

If you are affected, you can switch to a compatible Lightning (or Provider for Google) package if available from your distribution.

Ubuntu:

1. Open Thunderbird add-ons manager
2. Delete Lightning extension
3. Install package: xul-ext-lightning: sudo apt install xul-ext-lightning
4. Restart Thunderbird and calendar should be there

If the above doesn't work for you, please consult your distribution's documentation for the exact package name or the commands needed for step 3.

N.B.: currently some distributions provide packages in English only. To obtain a localized package please contact your distribution.

# Lightning reappears after a Thunderbird update although I opted out (release and beta versions)

If Lightning shows up for you again after a Thunderbird update and you don't want it:

1. Open Thunderbird's add-ons manager and switch to the list of installed extensions list your installed extensions
2. Click on the Remove to the right of the Lightning list item
3. Restart Thunderbird

This will stop bringing back Lightning after a Thunderbird update. If you change your mind in future, simply follow the instructions to restore a missing Lightning at the first section above (while leaving out steps 4 and 5).

# After a Thunderbird update, the first day of the week in the calendar views is set to Sunday

This was related to a cross update from a bundled version to a version from [ATN](https://addons.thunderbird.net) (formerly [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org)) add-ons distribution platform. This is resolved starting with Thunderbird 60.2.1. If you use a prior version and encounter this issue, please either update or reset the first day in a week to your needs:

1. Open the Calendar section in Thunderbird Settings and switch to the Views tab
2. Select in the Start the week on dropdown menu whatever is right for you

# When I use my user profile from a previous Thunderbird version with a newer version of Thunderbird, Lightning is not updated

If you are downloading a newer Thunderbird version instead of waiting for the automatic update or e.g. you want to test something in a beta version and you don't want to setup everything from scratch, you could use a previously used user profile. When doing so, the Lightning version should be updated when starting the Thunderbird with that profile. If it doesn't, then resetting will help - this doesn't affect your calendar data.

1. Start Thunderbird with the selected user profile
2. Go to the Advanced section of Thunderbird Settings and click on Config Editor...
3. Copy or start typing extensions.installedDistroAddon.{e2fda1a4-762b-4020-b5ad-a41df1933103} into the search box
4. When it is listed in the preferences list below, right-click on it and choose Reset from the context menu - the preference now isn't bold anymore and its value is empty
5. Restart Thunderbird

N.B.: if you do this e.g. for testing a beta version, and you want to continue to use that copy of the [profile](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"") on a previous version of Thunderbird afterwards, you will have to do the same procedure on that Thunderbird version again, since downgrades always trigger this behavior. Therefore for beta testing it is recommended to [use a separate (copy of the) user profile](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/using-multiple-profiles"").

# I am using Thunderbird Daily and Lightning doesn't seem to be updated, so I cannot see the latest fixes (Daily channel only!)

If you are using Thunderbird Daily, do not install Lightning using the add-ons manager.

The best version of the add-on is distributed automatically on the nightly update channel. So if you install using the add-ons manager it will cause the best version that was bundled to not be used.

If you think you are affected, you can check and fix it easily:

1. Open the Thunderbird add-ons manager
2. Switch to the Extensions list
3. If the Lightning item in the list has an Remove option, you have over-installed it (for any other addon this would be expected and doesn't require any action since doing the same would completely remove them)

To correct it just:

1. Press Remove for Lightning if present
2. Restart Thunderbird

Now you are getting served with the latest and greatest version of Lightning on every Thunderbird Daily update.

At [Thunderbird Add-ons](https://addons.thunderbird.net/) you can find and review the version compatibility information for each add-on. If your installed version of Thunderbird does not fit within the specified range, then installing the add-on or starting Thunderbird will fail or indicate the add-on is not compatible.

**A published add-on is the responsibility of its respective add-on author.** If an add-on does not work or is not compatible, you have these choices:

- Update to the latest version of Thunderbird. For more information, see [Updating Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/updating-thunderbird"").
- Find a version of the add-on that is compatible with your version of Thunderbird. The [Thunderbird Add-ons](https://addons.thunderbird.net/) website usually has the most up to date version.
- Use a different add-on. You can often find other add-ons with similar functionality at [Thunderbird Add-ons](https://addons.thunderbird.net/).
- Contact the author of the add-on at the support site listed on its add-on page. (Note: posting a review is not effective and will not reach the author.)

# Trouble installing Themes

[Install themes to change the look of Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-themes-change-look-thunderbird"") describes the purpose and installation process.

# You are asked to download the add-on, rather than allowed to install it

Some websites serve add-ons as downloads, requiring you to download the file to your computer, before installing it.

- These files are usually [.xpi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPInstall) or [.jar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_%28file_format%29) files. 

1. Download the file to your local computer.
2. Click ≡ \> Add-ons and Themes. The Add-ons Manager tab will open.
3. In the Add-ons Manager tab, select the Extensions panel.
4. To add the downloaded add-on to the list of available add-ons, drag and drop the file into the Add-ons window. The add-on is added to the list.
5. The installation process should begin.

**An add-on will not work if incompatible.**

# Corrupt extension files

Corrupt extension configuration files can cause problems when trying to install an add-on. Deleting these files will make Thunderbird recreate them the next time it starts. You won't lose your extensions or their settings by deleting these files.

1. Open your profile folder:  

  - Click ≡ \> Help and select Troubleshooting Information. The **Troubleshooting Information** tab will open.
  - Under the **Application Basics** section, find the _Profile Folder__Profile Directory_ row, then click on Open FolderShow in FinderOpen Directory. A window will open that contains your profile folder.Your profile folder will open.

2. Delete the following files:
  - extensions.sqlite
  - extensions.sqlite-journal (if found) 
  - extensions.ini
  - extensions.json
3. Restart Thunderbird.

# Conflict with another add-on

An already installed add-on may interfere with the installation of a new one. Install the new extension in Thunderbird [Safe Mode](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-mode-thunderbird"") as a workaround.

<p>How you change back to a release version depends on how you configured your profile data, and when you decide to make the change. If you only have one profile, then the best time to change is shortly before or within two to three weeks after a major version ships publicly, like when version 115 ships and the beta is still version 116. This timing will minimize the possibility that data structures have changed. You have two options:

<ul><li> Start the release version of Thunderbird to use the <a href=""/en-US/kb/using-multiple-profiles"">profile manager</a>.
</li><li> Delete the beta profile using the profile manager, default name is “default-beta”.

</li></ul>
</li><li> Beta program installed in its own directory, beta data is in a <a href=""/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation"">dedicated profile</a>, but you DO need beta data (address books, local folders, pop folders, etc.) copied back to your production profile. <strong>This gets messy and difficult, and is something you really want to avoid.</strong>

<h1 id=""w_what-changes-were-made-to-profiles-in-thunderbird-68"">What changes were made to profiles in Thunderbird 68?</h1>
<p>Some users have multiple installations of Thunderbird, each in a separate <span class=""for"" data-for=""mac,linux"">application</span><span class=""for"" data-for=""win"">program</span> folder. These multiple Thunderbird installations previously shared a single <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"">profile</a> by default. Beginning with Thunderbird version 68, Thunderbird by default will use a <a href=""/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation"">dedicated profile for each installation of Thunderbird</a> (including Beta and Nightly installations). This will make Thunderbird more stable when switching between installations on the same computer and will also allow you to run different Thunderbird installations at the same time.
</p>
<div class=""note"">You will not lose any personal data or customizations. Any previous profile data is saved and associated with the first Thunderbird installation that was opened after this change.</div>
<h1 id=""w_can-i-change-which-thunderbird-install-uses-my-previous-profile"">Can I change which Thunderbird install uses my previous profile?</h1>
<p>Yes. You can use the Profile Manager for each installation, to set a new default profile. Directions are available in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/using-multiple-profiles"">Using multiple profile</a> acticle.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_i-already-use-separate-profiles-for-my-different-thunderbird-installations"">I already use separate profiles for my different Thunderbird installations</h1>
<p>If you have already manually created separate profiles for different installations, you will not notice the change.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_what-happens-to-my-profile-if-i-downgrade-to-a-previous-version-of-thunderbird"">What happens to my profile if I downgrade to a previous version of Thunderbird</h1>
<p>To downgrade to a previous version you must use the procedures described in <a href=""/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation"">Dedicated profile per Thunderbird installation</a>. 
</p>
<h1 id=""w_i-need-to-use-my-old-profile-and-i-clicked-the-new-profile-button"">I need to use my old profile and I clicked the new profile button!</h1>
<p>If you have done this, you must change the default profile Thunderbird uses when it starts.  At the time of introducing this change there are no known incompatabilities with using an upgraded profile with an older version of Thunderbird, other than add-ons which may need to be removed and correct versions for the version of Thunderbird in use installed.  However, Thunderbird 68.5 implements <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1616495"">non-reversible changes to password storage</a>. Thunderbird 78 changes the address book format, so if you downgrade using this proceedure your downgraded profile will not have changes you made to your address book while using version 78.
</p>

# What changes were made to profiles in Thunderbird 68?

Some users have multiple installations of Thunderbird, each in a separate applicationprogram folder. These multiple Thunderbird installations previously shared a single [profile](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"") by default. Beginning with Thunderbird version 68, Thunderbird by default will use a [dedicated profile for each installation of Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation"") (including Beta and Nightly installations). This will make Thunderbird more stable when switching between installations on the same computer and will also allow you to run different Thunderbird installations at the same time.

You will not lose any personal data or customizations. Any previous profile data is saved and associated with the first Thunderbird installation that was opened after this change.

# Can I change which Thunderbird install uses my previous profile?

Yes. You can use the Profile Manager for each installation, to set a new default profile. Directions are available in the [Using multiple profile](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/using-multiple-profiles"") acticle.

# I already use separate profiles for my different Thunderbird installations

If you have already manually created separate profiles for different installations, you will not notice the change.

# What happens to my profile if I downgrade to a previous version of Thunderbird

To downgrade to a previous version you must use the procedures described in [Dedicated profile per Thunderbird installation](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation"").

# I need to use my old profile and I clicked the new profile button!

If you have done this, you must change the default profile Thunderbird uses when it starts. At the time of introducing this change there are no known incompatabilities with using an upgraded profile with an older version of Thunderbird, other than add-ons which may need to be removed and correct versions for the version of Thunderbird in use installed. However, Thunderbird 68.5 implements [non-reversible changes to password storage](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1616495). Thunderbird 78 changes the address book format, so if you downgrade using this proceedure your downgraded profile will not have changes you made to your address book while using version 78.

The information in the article [Using Multiple Profiles](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/using-multiple-profiles"") provides the information to invoke the Thunderbird profile manager. The expanded paths in the note will usually need to be used to locate the Thunderbird executable program. ""thunderbird.exe -p"" alone rarely works in a windows environment. 

Historically Thunderbird profiles have been created with the name ""default"" for the first profile, so your old profile name will most likely be ""default"".

This can cause an alert like ""The Local Directory path is not suitable for message storage"", to avoid storing your data in a directory where an application or the operating system might accidentally delete it. For example, a directory where an application is installed or temporary files are stored. It is also possible for an add-on to specify dangerous locations.
</p><p>Normally you will only run into this problem if you try to change where mail is stored, or you create a folder that has characters that might confuse Thunderbird. Thunderbird stores all of the mail for each folder in a file called a mbox file that is named after the folder, with no file extension. For example your inbox folder would be stored as ""inbox."". If the folder name contains special characters used by the operating system (like '*', '\', '/', ':', '?', '&gt;', '&lt;', or ""), the path to the mbox file (mail folder) can be ambiguous. Another potential problem might be using a folder name that is similar to a reserved file name such as ""places.sqlite"".

# Starting the Profile Manager

**Note:** You can manage profiles from the _About Profiles_ page when Thunderbird is open. If Thunderbird won't start or you need certain [options](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_options), you can also [start the Profile Manager when Thunderbird is closed](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_start-the-profile-manager-when-thunderbird-is-closed).

# Manage profiles when Thunderbird is open

Go to _Help \> Troubleshooting Information_ through the Thunderbird hamburger menu ![TB68_Hamburger_Menu_Button_Win](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) or menu bar. If the Thunderbird menu bar is not visible, press the Alt key on your keyboard to temporarily make it visible.

![TB68_Help_Menu_1_Win](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) or ![TB68_Help_Menu_2_Win](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

On the _Troubleshooting Information_ page that opens, click the _ **about:profiles** _ link.

![TB68_About_Profiles_Link_Win](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

This will open the _About Profiles_ page shown in the image below.

![TB68_About_Profiles_Page_Win](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) ![about:profiles macOS](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) ![Fx52_about-profiles-linux](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

The following options are available:

- Create a New Profile Click this and follow the prompts in the _Create Profile Wizard_ (see the [Creating a profile](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_creating-a-profile) section below for details). After you finish creating the new profile, it will be listed in the Profile Manager. The new profile will become the default and will be used the next time you start Thunderbird.

To manage profiles, find the profile you want to change and choose from these buttons underneath that profile:

- Rename Click this to change the name of a profile in the Profile Manager. **Note:** The folder containing the files for the profile is not renamed.

- Remove Click this to delete a profile. (The profile in use cannot be deleted.) _Don't Delete Files_ is the preferred option. See the [Removing a profile](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_removing-a-profile) section below for more information.

- Set as default profile This option allows you to switch profiles. Click this to make Thunderbird use this profile by default at startup. 

- Launch profile in new browser When you click this, another Thunderbird window will open using that profile.

# Start the Profile Manager when Thunderbird is closed

If you have multiple installations of Thunderbird, [see below](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_multiple-thunderbird-installations).

1. If Thunderbird is open, close Thunderbird.
2. Press ![Windows Key](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)+R on the keyboard. A Run dialog will open.
3. In the Run dialog box, type: `thunderbird -P`  
You can use `-P`, `-p` or `-ProfileManager` (any of them should work).  
  
 ![Run_Dialog_Win](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)  
  
4. Click OK. The Thunderbird Profile Manager (Choose User Profile) window should open.

</dt></dl>
If the above instructions do not work or if you have multiple installations of Thunderbird, use the following instructions instead.

## Multiple Thunderbird installations

You can have multiple Thunderbird programs installed in different locations. To start the Profile Manager for a specific Thunderbird installation, replace `thunderbird.exe` in the above instructions with the full path to the Thunderbird program, enclose that line in quotes, then add a space followed by -P.

Examples:   
_Thunderbird (32-bit) on 64-bit Windows_  
`""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe"" -P`

_Thunderbird (32-bit) on 32-bit Windows_ (or _[64-bit Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-tell-if-i-have-the-32-bit-or-64-bit-thunderbird"") on 64-bit Windows_)  
`""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe"" -P`

![TB_Full_Path_Run_Dialog_Win](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

1. If Thunderbird is open, close Thunderbird.
2. Using Finder navigate to /Applications/Utilities. 
3. Open the **Terminal** application.
4. In the Terminal application, enter the following:  
`/Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/thunderbird-bin -P`  

**Note:** If your Thunderbird application is in a location other than `/Applications/Thunderbird.app/`, adjust the entry.
**Important:** there's a space after the path, before `-P` (You can use ` -P`, ` -p` or ` -ProfileManager` after the path; any of them should work.)
5. Press Return. The Thunderbird Profile Manager (Choose User Profile) window should open.
<dl><dt>
<img alt=""Firefox Profile Manager"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2018-10-07-12-44-09-103333.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>

**Note:** You may need to adjust these instructions if Thunderbird is installed in a non-default location (for example, when multiple installations exist).

If Thunderbird is already included in your Linux distribution or if you have installed Thunderbird with the Thunderbirdpackage manager of your Linux distribution:

1. If Thunderbird is open, close Thunderbird.
2. In **Terminal** run:  
 `firefox -P`

**The P is capitalized.** Alternatively, you can use `-ProfileManager` instead of `-P`.  
The Thunderbird Profile Manager (Choose User Profile) window should open.

</dt></dl>

If the Profile Manager window still does not open, Thunderbird may have been running in the background, even though it was not visible. Close all instances of Thunderbird or restart the computer and then try again.

## Creating a profile

After starting the Profile Manager as explained above, you can create a new, additional profile as follows:

1. In the Profile Manager, click Create Profile… to start the Create Profile Wizard.

</dt></dl>
3. Disregard the Choose Folder prompt unless you wish to choose where to store the profile on your computer. 
**Warning:** If you choose your own folder location for the profile, select a new or empty folder. If you choose a folder that isn't empty and you later remove the profile and choose the ""Delete Files"" option, everything inside that folder will be deleted.
4. To create the new profile, click FinishDone.

You will be taken back to the Profile Manager and the new profile will be listed.

## Removing a profile

After starting the Profile Manager as explained above, you can remove an existing profile as follows:

  - Don't Delete Files removes the profile from the Profile Manager yet retains the profile data files on your computer in the storage folder, so that your information is not lost. ""Don't Delete Files"" is the preferred option because it saves the old profile's folder and allows you to recover the files to a new profile. 
  - Delete Files removes the profile and its files (including the profile bookmarks, settings, passwords, etc.). If you use the ""Delete Files"" option, the profile folder and files will be deleted. **This action cannot be undone.**
  - Cancel interrupts the profile deletion.

After starting the Profile Manager as explained above, you can rename a profile as follows:

1. In the Profile Manager, select the profile to rename, and then click Rename Profile….
2. Type a new name for the profile, then click OK or press Enter.

If you have important information from an old Thunderbird profile, such as bookmarks, passwords, or user preferences, you can transfer that information to a new Thunderbird profile by copying the associated files. For instructions, see [Recovering important data from an old profile](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recovering-important-data-from-an-old-profile""). You can also switch to a previous profile to recover old profile data. See [Recover user data missing after Firefox update](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recover-user-data-missing-after-firefox-update"") for details.

# What are profiles?

Thunderbird saves information such as addresses, messages, passwords and user preferences in a set of files called a profile. This profile is stored in a location separate from the Thunderbird applicationprogram files. More information about Thunderbird profiles can be found [here](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"").

# What profile changes were made in Thunderbird 68?

Some users have multiple program installations of Thunderbird on the same computer; for example, Thunderbird 38, Thunderbird 45, Thunderbird 52 and Thunderbird 60, each installed in a separate applicationprogram folder. In these older Thunderbird installations it was allowed to share the same profile by default.

However, with version 68 and newer versions a dedicated profile is used for each program installation of Thunderbird (including [Nightly and Beta](https://www.thunderbird.net/#channel)). This makes Thunderbird more stable when switching between installations on the same computer, and also allows you to run different installations of Thunderbird at the same time.

**Tip:** To see what Thunderbird version you're on, see [Find what version of Thunderbird you are using](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-what-version-thunderbird-you-are-using"").

You will not lose any personal data or customizations. Previous profile data is saved and associated with the first Thunderbird installation that was opened after this change. Details of why these changes were made is explained in the Firefox article [Understanding in depth the profile per installation feature](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/understanding-depth-profile-installation"").

# What are my options?

If you do nothing, your profile data will be different with each installation of Thunderbird.

# Can I change which Thunderbird installation uses my previously shared profile?

Yes. You can use the Profile Manager for any installation to set a new default profile for that particular installation.

# What happens to my profile if I downgrade to a previous version of Thunderbird?

You should create a new profile to avoid corruption issues.

Starting with [Thunderbird version](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-what-version-thunderbird-you-are-using"") 68, each Thunderbird installation requires a separate profile. Any previous [profile data](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"") is saved and associated with the first Thunderbird installation opened after the change.

<h1 id=""w_what-is-end-to-end-encryption-in-thunderbird"">What is End-to-End Encryption in Thunderbird?</h1>
<p>End-to-end encryption (e2ee) for email can be used to ensure that only the sender and the recipients of a message can read the contents.  Without this protection it is easy for network administrators, email providers and government agencies to read your messages.
</p><p>Achieving e2ee requires carefulness by both the sender and the recipients. A single mistake by any of the involved parties can be sufficient to break the security of e2ee.
</p><p>Also, email metadata cannot be protected using e2ee. Examples are name and address of sender and recipients, time message was sent, or from which computer emails are sent or received. The subject of the mail may also remain unprotected and easily readable, even when e2ee is used.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_how-e2ee-with-openpgp-works-in-general"">How e2ee with OpenPGP works in general</h2>
<p>Thunderbird handles most of the details so that you don't need to worry about them. But we recommend you attempt to understand how it works, which is described below, so that you reduce your risk of making mistakes and are not fully protected.
</p><p>Encryption uses a mathematical procedure to make messages unreadable. Making a message readable again is called decryption, and requires knowledge of the involved secrets.
</p><p>The ancient approach to encryption required that two people meet and share a secret, which would then be used to both encrypt by the sender, and would later be used by the recipient to decrypt the message.
</p><p>E2ee for email uses a modern approach called public key cryptography. The use of e2ee with public key cryptography requires that every sender and recipient does a one time preparation, which involves the generation of personal random numbers. Two such random numbers are necessary, one will be called your secret key and another one will be called your public key. These numbers are very big, they consist of hundreds or thousands of digits.
</p><p>Using clever mathematics, a message can be encrypted (made unreadable) using the public key. The message can be decrypted (made readable) only by the person who is in possession of the matching secret key.  In other words, if you give your public key to someone else then they can use this key to encrypt a message for you. And the result is data that cannot be read by anyone but you. Then they send the encrypted data to you. Then you use your secret key to decrypt the data and can read the message.
</p><p>The pair of your secret key and its related public key is called a personal key. <strong>You must never share the secret key with anyone else</strong> because then it's obviously no longer a secret, and it's no longer a personal key.  If you share your secret key with someone else, then that other person can also read the encrypted messages that are sent to you. Or if you are careless and store your secret key without protection, or if you backup your secret to the cloud without protection, then it might be easy for someone to steal your secret key and use it to read all encrypted messages that are sent to you.
</p><p>Also if you lose your secret key, for example if you lose your computer or if you erase all data on your computer, then you will no longer be able to read your encrypted messages. <strong>Your messages are not recoverable in any way, by anyone, if this happens.</strong>
</p><p>There are additional ways in which the security of e2ee can be broken, and that involves using the wrong public key. The following is an example:
</p><p>If Alice wants to send an encrypted email to Bob, she needs to obtain Bob's public key. The public key is a big number, so it must be transmitted over the internet, either in an email, or downloaded from a web site, or downloaded from a directory. If Alice encrypts an email using Bob's key, and if Bob is careful to never share his secret key with anyone else, then only Bob will be able to decrypt and read the message.
</p><p>However, the difficulty is to ensure that Alice really obtained Bob's public key. Someone could try to trick Alice and Bob, in an attempt to intercept their communication for surveillance purposes. For example Eve could create a rogue key and send it to Alice, presenting it as Bob's key. If Alice believes that this key belongs to Bob and uses it to encrypt messages to Bob, then Eve will be able to read the message that Alice sent. You could compare this to obtaining the wrong postal address of someone, so that the letters from Alice to Bob go to Eve's house instead. Eve then opens the letter, reads it and sends it on to Bob, possibly altering some details.
</p><p>To guarantee the security of e2ee, it is important to verify that you have really obtained Bob's key, not a rogue key.
</p><p>Whenever you receive a public key from one of your correspondents, you should be aware of the risk that it might be a rogue key. If you cannot risk that are you tricked by Eve, then you should doublecheck that you have received Bob's correct public key.
</p><p>The common way to doublecheck is to communicate with Bob once, using a mechanism that allows you to confirm that you are really talking to Bob. For example, you could use a video call, or if you recognize Bob's voice, a phone call. Or you could meet in person.
</p><p>Once you are communicating with Bob, you should open the details of the public key that you have received. Thunderbird will show you a special checksum, that is also called a fingerprint, which is a combination of around 40 characters and letters. Bob should do the same for his own fingerprint, and should read the fingerprint to you. You should look at your own computer screen, and verify that it matches what you see on your own computer. If it doesn't match then you have downloaded the incorrect key, or someone is trying to trick you - in practice, your communication is under surveillance. If it matches completely then you can mark the key as verified, and your software will remember it.
</p><p>The concept of public and secret keys might be easier to understand with the following analogy. Think of a public key as a little box that can be locked. You can have as many little boxes as you want. You can share your boxes, or make them available for download, or even add them to a directory. Other people can find your boxes on the Internet. They can place a secret message inside it, and lock it, and then send the box to you. Your secret key is like a real key, and can be used to unlock the box. Because only you have the matching key, only you can unlock the box. If you want to be certain that you really got Bob's box, not Eve's box, you need to look at the number that's written on the outside of the box, which is called the fingerprint. Talk to Bob using video chat, phone or in person, and verify that the fingerprint on the box matches what Bob tells you.
</p><p>Also be aware that it is easy to make mistakes when using encrypted email. Consider if Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob, and Bob might decide to forward the message to Carol. Carol might have never prepared to use e2ee, or Bob might not have Carol's public key. If Bob forwards Alice's message to Carol without encryption then the contents of the original message are no longer protected. Consequently, if you exchange sensitive contents by email, you might want to ask your communication partners to not forward your emails.
</p><p>As a bonus, the technology used for e2ee can also be used to digitally sign a message. The from address shown in email might have been modified by a person who is trying to mislead you. If Bob sends an email to Alice, he could use his secret key to create a digital signature. (Under the hood, this works by calculating a special number.) Alice can use Bob's public key to confirm that only Bob was able to create this signature, because only Bob owns the matching secret key. If Alice has verified the fingerprint of Bob's key, and if all numbers match the automatic checks by Thunderbird, then the message is known to be really sent by Bob. Of course, we still assume that Bob is careful with his secret key and never shared it.

<p>If you send encrypted messages, the messages in your sent folder will be encrypted. If you lose your secret key, you will be unable to read your archived messages. <strong>These messages cannot be recovered!</strong>
</p><p>All devices on which you read encrypted messages must be configured to use the same personal key. If you are using software other than Thunderbird, that software may not support end-to-end encryption. For example reading encrypted emails on your phone will require some setting up.

<h1 id=""w_how-to-use-openpgp-end-to-end-encryption-with-thunderbird"">How to use OpenPGP End-to-end encryption with Thunderbird</h1>
<p>Thunderbird will not attempt to use e2ee automatically. To use e2ee you must configure your personal key. The configuration section can be found in Thunderbird's account setting, in the End-to-end encryption tab. Once you have a personal key configured, you can control the use of encryption or digital signing in individual message that you send.
</p><p>For each email address at which you want to receive encrypted email, or that you want to use to send digitally signed email, you need to create your personal key.
</p><p>You should avoid having multiple personal keys. If you use two devices to read messages from the same email account, you probably want to be able to read the encrypted messages you receive on both devices.
Therefore, only generate a personal key once. Then backup your personal key to a file. It is recommended that you use a strong password to protect that backup of your personal key, to make it difficult for anyone else to use your backup file to get your secret key. Copy that backup file to the other device, enter the password to  unlock the backup, and then import the personal key on that device.
</p><p>Once you have created your personal key, you need to enable other people to obtain your public key. Be careful, and never share your secret key with anyone. However, the public key may be widely shared so that people can send you encrypted emails and verify your digital signatures.
</p><p>When composing an email, there is an arrow shown behind the security button on the toolbar. Click the arrow to select the menu choice ""attach my public key"".
</p><p>Recipients will see an attachment in your email with a filename that starts with ""OpenPGP"". If the recipient uses Thunderbird then they can right click that message to open a menu with choices, and from that menu they can select ""Import OpenPGP Key"".

# What is End-to-End Encryption in Thunderbird?

End-to-end encryption (e2ee) for email can be used to ensure that only the sender and the recipients of a message can read the contents. Without this protection it is easy for network administrators, email providers and government agencies to read your messages.

Achieving e2ee requires carefulness by both the sender and the recipients. A single mistake by any of the involved parties can be sufficient to break the security of e2ee.

Also, email metadata cannot be protected using e2ee. Examples are name and address of sender and recipients, time message was sent, or from which computer emails are sent or received. The subject of the mail may also remain unprotected and easily readable, even when e2ee is used.

## How e2ee with OpenPGP works in general

Thunderbird handles most of the details so that you don't need to worry about them. But we recommend you attempt to understand how it works, which is described below, so that you reduce your risk of making mistakes and are not fully protected.

Encryption uses a mathematical procedure to make messages unreadable. Making a message readable again is called decryption, and requires knowledge of the involved secrets.

The ancient approach to encryption required that two people meet and share a secret, which would then be used to both encrypt by the sender, and would later be used by the recipient to decrypt the message.

E2ee for email uses a modern approach called public key cryptography. The use of e2ee with public key cryptography requires that every sender and recipient does a one time preparation, which involves the generation of personal random numbers. Two such random numbers are necessary, one will be called your secret key and another one will be called your public key. These numbers are very big, they consist of hundreds or thousands of digits.

Using clever mathematics, a message can be encrypted (made unreadable) using the public key. The message can be decrypted (made readable) only by the person who is in possession of the matching secret key. In other words, if you give your public key to someone else then they can use this key to encrypt a message for you. And the result is data that cannot be read by anyone but you. Then they send the encrypted data to you. Then you use your secret key to decrypt the data and can read the message.

The pair of your secret key and its related public key is called a personal key. **You must never share the secret key with anyone else** because then it's obviously no longer a secret, and it's no longer a personal key. If you share your secret key with someone else, then that other person can also read the encrypted messages that are sent to you. Or if you are careless and store your secret key without protection, or if you backup your secret to the cloud without protection, then it might be easy for someone to steal your secret key and use it to read all encrypted messages that are sent to you.

Also if you lose your secret key, for example if you lose your computer or if you erase all data on your computer, then you will no longer be able to read your encrypted messages. **Your messages are not recoverable in any way, by anyone, if this happens.**

There are additional ways in which the security of e2ee can be broken, and that involves using the wrong public key. The following is an example:

For example Eve could create a rogue key and send it to Alice, presenting it as Bob's key. If Alice believes that this key belongs to Bob and uses it to encrypt messages to Bob, then Eve will be able to read the message that Alice sent. You could compare this to obtaining the wrong postal address of someone, so that the letters from Alice to Bob go to Eve's house instead. Eve then opens the letter, reads it and sends it on to Bob, possibly altering some details.

To guarantee the security of e2ee, it is important to verify that you have really obtained Bob's key, not a rogue key.

Whenever you receive a public key from one of your correspondents, you should be aware of the risk that it might be a rogue key. If you cannot risk that are you tricked by Eve, then you should doublecheck that you have received Bob's correct public key.

The common way to doublecheck is to communicate with Bob once, using a mechanism that allows you to confirm that you are really talking to Bob. For example, you could use a video call, or if you recognize Bob's voice, a phone call. Or you could meet in person.

Once you are communicating with Bob, you should open the details of the public key that you have received. Thunderbird will show you a special checksum, that is also called a fingerprint, which is a combination of around 40 characters and letters. Bob should do the same for his own fingerprint, and should read the fingerprint to you. You should look at your own computer screen, and verify that it matches what you see on your own computer. If it doesn't match then you have downloaded the incorrect key, or someone is trying to trick you - in practice, your communication is under surveillance. If it matches completely then you can mark the key as verified, and your software will remember it.

The concept of public and secret keys might be easier to understand with the following analogy. Think of a public key as a little box that can be locked. You can have as many little boxes as you want. You can share your boxes, or make them available for download, or even add them to a directory. Other people can find your boxes on the Internet. They can place a secret message inside it, and lock it, and then send the box to you. Your secret key is like a real key, and can be used to unlock the box. Because only you have the matching key, only you can unlock the box. If you want to be certain that you really got Bob's box, not Eve's box, you need to look at the number that's written on the outside of the box, which is called the fingerprint. Talk to Bob using video chat, phone or in person, and verify that the fingerprint on the box matches what Bob tells you.

Also be aware that it is easy to make mistakes when using encrypted email. Consider if Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob, and Bob might decide to forward the message to Carol. Carol might have never prepared to use e2ee, or Bob might not have Carol's public key. If Bob forwards Alice's message to Carol without encryption then the contents of the original message are no longer protected. Consequently, if you exchange sensitive contents by email, you might want to ask your communication partners to not forward your emails.

As a bonus, the technology used for e2ee can also be used to digitally sign a message. The from address shown in email might have been modified by a person who is trying to mislead you. If Bob sends an email to Alice, he could use his secret key to create a digital signature. (Under the hood, this works by calculating a special number.) Alice can use Bob's public key to confirm that only Bob was able to create this signature, because only Bob owns the matching secret key. If Alice has verified the fingerprint of Bob's key, and if all numbers match the automatic checks by Thunderbird, then the message is known to be really sent by Bob. Of course, we still assume that Bob is careful with his secret key and never shared it.

## How e2ee with S/MIME works in general

Although S/MIME uses some of the same concepts as OpenPGP, it is used differently.

At a future time this article will be extended to cover S/MIME.

## What are the consequences of using e2ee

If you send encrypted messages, the messages in your sent folder will be encrypted. If you lose your secret key, you will be unable to read your archived messages. **These messages cannot be recovered!**

All devices on which you read encrypted messages must be configured to use the same personal key. If you are using software other than Thunderbird, that software may not support end-to-end encryption. For example reading encrypted emails on your phone will require some setting up.

If you lose your secret key, other people can continue to send you encrypted email, and you will be unable to read them.

Note: Search functions in general do not work for the body content of encrypted messages.

# How to use OpenPGP End-to-end encryption with Thunderbird

Thunderbird will not attempt to use e2ee automatically. To use e2ee you must configure your personal key. The configuration section can be found in Thunderbird's account setting, in the End-to-end encryption tab. Once you have a personal key configured, you can control the use of encryption or digital signing in individual message that you send.

For each email address at which you want to receive encrypted email, or that you want to use to send digitally signed email, you need to create your personal key.

You should avoid having multiple personal keys. If you use two devices to read messages from the same email account, you probably want to be able to read the encrypted messages you receive on both devices. Therefore, only generate a personal key once. Then backup your personal key to a file. It is recommended that you use a strong password to protect that backup of your personal key, to make it difficult for anyone else to use your backup file to get your secret key. Copy that backup file to the other device, enter the password to unlock the backup, and then import the personal key on that device.

Once you have created your personal key, you need to enable other people to obtain your public key. Be careful, and never share your secret key with anyone. However, the public key may be widely shared so that people can send you encrypted emails and verify your digital signatures.

When composing an email, there is an arrow shown behind the security button on the toolbar. Click the arrow to select the menu choice ""attach my public key"".

Recipients will see an attachment in your email with a filename that starts with ""OpenPGP"". If the recipient uses Thunderbird then they can right click that message to open a menu with choices, and from that menu they can select ""Import OpenPGP Key"".

<h2 id=""w_what-is-end-to-end-encryption-about-and-how-does-it-work"">What is end-to-end encryption about, and how does it work?</h2>
<p>End-to-end encryption (e2ee) makes communications safer against being spied on by third parties. Please refer to the article <a href=""/en-US/kb/introduction-to-e2e-encryption"">Introduction to End-to-end encryption in Thunderbird</a> where we explain some of the basics.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_does-thunderbird-support-openpgp"">Does Thunderbird support OpenPGP?</h2>
<p>Yes. Thunderbird 78 has built-in support for two encryption standards, OpenPGP and S/MIME. OpenPGP has been enabled by default since version 78.2.1.
</p><p>Previous versions of Thunderbird (version 68 and before) had built-in S/MIME support, and it was possible to add OpenPGP support using the Enigmail add-on and GnuPG software. The Enigmail add-on is no longer available for Thunderbird 78 except to assist its former users with migrating to the built-in OpenPGP support or getting guidance how to restore their Enigmail “Junior Mode” user experience.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_why-was-enigmail-replaced-and-will-it-come-back"">Why was Enigmail replaced and will it come back?</h2>
<p>The Enigmail add-on was replaced with built-in support for OpenPGP in Thunderbird 78.
</p><p>This change was necessary because Thunderbird stopped supporting legacy add-ons, like Enigmail, in <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/78.0/releasenotes/"">Thunderbird 78</a>. The same change happened in <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/11/23/add-ons-in-2017/"">Firefox in 2017</a>. Thunderbird followed in 2020 because it is sharing Mozilla platform code with Firefox.
</p><p>Enigmail will <a href=""https://enigmail.net/index.php/en/home/news/70-2019-10-08-future-openpgp-support-in-thunderbird"">not be further developped</a> or migrated to other add-on technologies. About this change, Patrick Brunschwig, author of Enigmail, wrote:
</p><p><em>“It has always been my goal to have OpenPGP support included in the core Thunderbird product. Even though it will mark an end to a long story, after working on Enigmail for 17 years, I’m very happy with this outcome.”</em>
</p>
<h2 id=""w_does-openpgp-in-thunderbird-78-look-and-work-exactly-like-enigmail"">Does OpenPGP in Thunderbird 78 look and work exactly like Enigmail?</h2>
<p>No, there are several differences in the user interface and features offered. Thunderbird’s built-in OpenPGP support is <em>not</em> an exact copy of Thunderbird with Enigmail. Thunderbird wants to offer a fully integrated solution, and is no longer using GnuPG by default to avoid licensing issues. This document explains the differences:<br>
<a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Migration-From-Enigmail"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Migration-From-Enigmail</a>
</p>
<h2 id=""w_i-have-never-used-openpgp-with-thunderbird-before-how-do-i-setup-openpgp"">I have never used OpenPGP with Thunderbird before: How do I setup OpenPGP?</h2>
<p>To use OpenPGP functionality in Thunderbird, you need to set a so-called personal key pair for your email address. You can do that in the <span class=""menu"">End-to-End Encryption</span> subsection of your account settings. If you have already used OpenPGP with other software, you need to import a backup copy of your existing key. Otherwise, you can create a new key.
</p>
<ul><li> <span class=""menu"">≡</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Account Settings</span> &gt; <em>select your account</em> &gt; <span class=""menu"">End-to-End Encryption</span> &gt; <span class=""button"">Add Key…</span>
<ul><li> If you already have a personal OpenPGP key pair from another software, choose <span class=""menu"">Import an existing PGP key</span>.
</li><li> If you don't have a key yet, choose <span class=""menu"">Create a New OpenPGP key</span>.
</li></ul>
</li><li> After importing or creating it, while still in account settings, select the key you want to actively use with your email account.
</li></ul>
<p>Note that using OpenPGP has consequences as explained in the general introduction. It is important to make a backup of your key and store it in a secure location, separate from your regular computer.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_i-have-previously-used-enigmail-how-do-i-migrate-and-configure"">I have previously used Enigmail, how do I migrate and configure?</h2>
<p>You can upgrade your Thunderbird settings from an older version (such as 68.x) to version 78.x
It is recommended that you make a backup of your old Thunderbird profile before you use Thunderbird 78 for the first time, because once you have upgraded, your profile can no longer be used with Thunderbird 68. If for any reason you decide that you must continue to use Thunderbird 68 and Enigmail, a backup will allow you to go back easily.
</p><p>Enigmail is currently available in two versions, 2.1.x and 2.2.x:
</p>
<ul><li> Enigmail 2.1.x only works with Thunderbird 68 and older release versions, and provides the classic functionality. 
</li><li> Enigmail version 2.2.x is a specially modified version, which only works with Thunderbird 78 and later version. Enigmail 2.2.x doesn't provide the traditional functionality, rather it exists to help you migrate your keys and settings to Thunderbird 78.
</li></ul>
<p>If you start Thunderbird 78 with an existing profile, and the previous profile had Enigmail installed, then Thunderbird 78 will detect that the previous Enigmail 2.1.x Add-on is not compatible. It should automatically check for a newer version, it will find Enigmail 2.2.x and install it. Then Enigmail will automatically open a tab that greets you and explains that migration is possible, and offers to start it.
</p><p>Enigmail was using GnuPG to store and manage all keys and trust settings. If you click the button to start the migration, the Enigmail migration software will read your old keys from GnuPG one after the other. You must enter passwords to confirm the export of your keys from GnuPG and to allow them to be unlocked for importing them into Thunderbird's new internal key storage.
</p><p>Thunderbird 78 uses different settings than Enigmail. With Enigmail, it was possible to enable OpenPGP for an email account, but let it automatically select which of your keys would be used. Thunderbird 78 combines these settings. To enable OpenPGP for an email account, it is necessary to explicitly specify which personal key to use.
</p><p>Consequently, if you had previously used the automatic selection, then the migration might not have selected a key yet. After the migration, you should manually check the configuration of all your email accounts and identities, and if necessary, manually select the appropriate key.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_the-enigmail-migration-has-completed-successfully-but-im-still-unable-to-use-openpgp"">The Enigmail migration has completed successfully, but I'm still unable to use OpenPGP.</h2>
<p>If you had Enigmail enabled for an email account on Thunderbird 68, and you enabled the preference ""Use email address of this identity to identify OpenPGP key"", then OpenPGP may not be enabled automatically in Thunderbird 78. You need to use account settings to manually select an OpenPGP key for every account and identity which you want to use with OpenPGP. Unfortunately, Enigmail migration does not automatically select them for you.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_can-i-repeat-the-migration"">Can I repeat the migration?</h2>
<p>Note that migration requires the use of Thunderbird 78.x. Using Thunderbird 91 and later, the migration Add-on  is no longer available. If you still need to upgrade from Thunderbird 68 or older, you could manually download Thunderbird 78 to perform the migration, then upgrade to the latest Thunderbird version afterwards.
</p><p>If there is any problem with the migration with Thunderbird 78.x, you can repeat it. For example, the migration may fail if you experience a bug in Thunderbird, or if you did not remember the password for all of your personal keys, and did only a partial migration. To repeat the migration, you need to access a command from the top menu bar. If you are using Windows or Linux, and the top menu bar isn't visible, use a mouse right click in the top area of the Thunderbird main window, and enable the menu bar. Then use the Tools menu, which contains the command ""Migrate Enigmail Settings"".

<h2 id=""w_i-tried-to-import-a-file-with-public-keys-and-i-get-an-error-message-that-the-file-is-too-big"">I tried to import a file with public keys, and I get an error message that the file is too big.</h2>
<p>Please see the answer to the following question.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_i-previously-used-openpgp-with-gnupg-but-with-a-different-email-software-how-can-i-migrate-my-keys-to-thunderbird-78"">I previously used OpenPGP with GnuPG, but with a different email software. How can I migrate my keys to Thunderbird 78?</h2>
<p>You need to first export your keys from the other software and then re-import them to Thunderbird.
</p><p>As a way of exporting your personal keys (also called private or secret keys), you could use a command from command prompt to export them to a file. To export keys managed by GnuPG, you could use the following command:
</p><p>gpg --export-secret-keys --armor &gt; my-secret-keys.asc
</p><p>Then you can import them into Thunderbird. Either use the Add Key and Import functionality in Thunderbird account settings, end-to-end encryption. Or use the global menu bar to open the Tools menu which offers the OpenPGP Key Manager. Use File Import Secret Keys and select the file you have created above. (Both import methods work with secret/private keys, only.)
You probably have only a small amount of personal keys, therefore this approach should work.
</p><p>You may use a similar approach for exporting the public keys of your correspondents and use the following command:
</p><p>gpg --export --armor &gt; all-public-keys.asc
</p><p>However, if you have many keys, you might experience a problem because of a current limitation in Thunderbird.
Currently, Thunderbird cannot import a large set of keys in a single step. An attempt to import a file that is bigger than 5 MB will be rejected.
</p><p>You have two options to work around this limitation.
</p>
<ul><li> The first option is to use a graphical key manager for GnuPG and export your keys into separate files. For example, if all public keys in total have a size of 17 MB, you would have to create 4 files, and select a quarter of public keys for each exported file. This is a bit cumbersome.
</li><li> Alternatively, you could try to use the Enigmail version 2.2.x migration Add-on for importing public keys into Thunderbird, even if you haven't used Enigmail before.
</li></ul>
<p>To do so, use Thunderbird 78 and search for the Enigmail Add-on. You will be offered to install version 2.2.x. Once installed, you can manually access the command ""Migrate Enigmail Settings"" from Thunderbird's top menu bar, in the Tools submenu.
Note that this may fail, depending on how you have set up GnuPG software on your computer, so it cannot be guaranteed that this approach works.
</p><p>If GnuPG software has been correctly installed on your computer, the Enigmail migration Add-on will find it and import all public keys from GnuPG into Thunderbird one by one, without being affected by the above-mentioned sized limit.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_enigmail-reports-that-migration-of-my-private-key-has-failed"">Enigmail reports that migration of my private key has failed.</h2>
<p>This could mean that you were trying to import a key that is not yet supported by RNP.
Another possible reason is an incomplete setup of GnuPG software on your computer, especially if you were not prompted to enter a password to export your private key – this shouldn't apply if you have recently successfully used Enigmail on your computer.
</p><p>A good way to ensure that you have correctly installed GnuPG is to use the following procedure:
</p>
<ul><li> Install Thunderbird 68 into a separate directory, then run Thunderbird 68 with parameter -P and run it with a separate profile. (You don't need to configure an email account, you may cancel that suggestion.)
</li><li> Then install Enigmail into your Thunderbird 68 profile, and execute the Enigmail setup wizard, which will help you to setup GnuPG software correctly.
</li></ul>
<p>If this didn't help, you could check the Enigmail FAQ: <a href=""https://enigmail.net/index.php/en/faq-en?view=topic&amp;id=14"">https://enigmail.net/index.php/en/faq-en?view=topic&amp;id=14</a>
</p>
<h2 id=""w_what-types-of-openpgp-keys-are-supported"">What types of OpenPGP keys are supported?</h2>
<p>Please note: Thunderbird uses the RNP software for processing keys, which may not yet support certain types of keys. This means that certain keys which are supported by GnuPG / Enigmail may not work with Thunderbird 78 by default, especially some keys with an advanced structure. <strong>However, for private keys, you might solve the problem by configuring Thunderbird to use GnuPG</strong>, as explained in the next section.
</p><p>For private keys that are stored on a smartcard, please see the separate section about smartcard support.
</p><p>Thunderbird 91 and later supports importing and using OpenPGP personal keys with an offline primary key. The term offline means that the secret key for the primary key is intentionally absent. Note that Thunderbird itself doesn't support creating such a key, it's necessary to use external OpenPGP software (e.g. GnuPG) to create this key configuration, which could then be exported from GnuPG, and then imported into Thunderbird.
</p>
<div class=""warning""><strong>The following keys are <em>not</em> or <em>not yet</em> supported by Thunderbird <em>by default</em>:</strong>
<ul><li> Certain keys that are incomplete, for example those using an offline primary key.
</li><li> Keys that use a different password for a sub key
</li><li> Keys located on a smartcard.
</li><li> Keys using the MD5 hash algorithm.
</li><li> Certain other keys that RNP may not yet support.
</li></ul>
If you find that a key does not work with Thunderbird, please report it! If possible, and only if it is a public key, please include a copy of the key. <strong>Please be careful and never send us your secret/private keys!</strong></div>
<div class=""warning""><strong>Keys using SHA-1 hashes</strong>
Thunderbird 91.8 attempted to deprecate OpenPGP keys that contain properties that were signed using the SHA-1 has algorithm, but the change was reverted, as too many users were negatively affected. More details about the deprecation plan can be found in this blog post: <a href=""https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/05/openpgp-keys-and-sha-1/"">https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/05/openpgp-keys-and-sha-1/</a> .</div>
<h2 id=""w_i-have-imported-my-secret-key-but-thunderbird-cannot-decrypt-my-emails"">I have imported my secret key, but Thunderbird cannot decrypt my emails.</h2>
<p>Maybe you imported the wrong key?
To check that you have really imported the right key, you can do the following:
</p>
<ol><li> In Thunderbird, click on a message that you think you should be able to decrypt, but cannot decrypt.
</li><li> Use <span class=""button"">≡</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Save As</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">File</span> and save your message to a file on disk (e.g. /tmp/test.eml).
</li><li> Open a terminal. Run this command: <strong>gpg --list-packets /tmp/test.eml</strong><br>You should get a listing of key IDs that can be used to decrypt the message (encrypted with ... ID ...).
</li><li> Now go back to Thunderbird: <span class=""button"">≡</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Tools</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">OpenPGP Key Manager</span>.
</li><li> For each of the secret keys that you have available (listed as bold), double-click to view key properties, then click on the structure tab.
</li></ol>
<p>Can you find the ID that was shown above by <em>gpg</em>?
You need to have the secret keys for at least one of the IDs that were shown by <em>gpg</em>.
If you do not have any matching secret key, then you cannot decrypt the message.
If you <em>do</em> have a matching secret, but Thunderbird still fails to decrypt the message, please <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=MailNews%20Core&amp;component=Security%3A%20OpenPGP"">report a bug against Thunderbird</a> with more details about your key.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_if-my-secret-key-isnt-supported-by-thunderbird-what-can-i-do"">If my secret key isn't supported by Thunderbird, what can I do?</h2>
<p>Thunderbird 78 allows you to optionally set up the external software called GnuPG for handling your secret keys (for digital signing and decryption of received messages).
This will enable the use of smartcards or hardware tokens that store a secret key. You may also use it for keys that are stored in files on your computer and are not supported by Thunderbird’s built-in OpenPGP implementation.
</p><p>You need to install and configure the required GnuPG software yourself, because it cannot be distributed together with Thunderbird. Therefore this mechanism isn't enabled by default.
To learn how to use it, please refer to the next question about smartcards.
</p><p>Note that public keys and their acceptance settings (for encryption and signature verification) are always handled by Thunderbird's internal code.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_can-i-use-an-openpgp-smartcard-or-a-hardware-token-with-thunderbird-78"">Can I use an OpenPGP smartcard or a hardware token with Thunderbird 78?</h2>
<p>Yes, we offer an optional mechanism.
It requires that you install GnuPG and all required software yourself.
Please refer to this document for more details:
<a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Smartcards"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Smartcards</a>
</p>
<h2 id=""w_how-do-i-send-an-encrypted-or-digitally-signed-email"">How do I send an encrypted or digitally signed email?</h2>
<p>Ensure that you have configured your personal key for your email account or identity.
When you write an email, use the Options menu, or the menu found on the security button, and enable the protection you would like to use.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_what-is-needed-to-send-an-encrypted-message"">What is needed to send an encrypted message?</h2>
<ul><li> You must have your personal key set up and selected.
</li><li> You must have an accepted public key for every recipient of an encrypted message which you want to send. Public keys are often attached to the email messages of your correspondents. There is more information on getting public keys from others in another section of this document.
</li><li> You must verify that the public keys of your correspondents really belong to them. If you accept someone’s public key without verifying it, you will be exposing your communication to Monster In The Middle attacks (MITM).
</li><li> If you don't have a public key for every recipient, sending of your message will be blocked, and Thunderbird will alert you. You can choose between not sending the message at all, or disabling encryption and sending the message without protection, or only send the message to the subset of recipients for who you do have public keys.
</li></ul>
<h2 id=""w_what-does-key-acceptance-mean"">What does key acceptance mean?</h2>
<p>Technically, anyone is able to create an OpenPGP key in anyone's name, using any email address they want. Nobody is able to limit or prevent that. This means, whenever you receive a correspondent's public key, you risk that it is a false key, and an attempt to trick you.
Unless you have verified your correspondent's key, you might not be having a confidential conversation, but rather you might be the victim of a Monster-In-The-Middle attack (MITM).
It is your decision if you care about this attack vector, and you might want to decide individually based on the correspondent.
</p><p>If you accept a key, it means you are willing to use that key for sending encrypted messages to that correspondent. If you receive an email from a correspondent, your acceptance decision controls how the digital signature will be displayed. Only signatures from accepted keys will be shown as valid.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_why-do-i-have-to-mark-my-own-secret-key-as-accepted-as-a-personal-key"">Why do I have to mark my own secret key as accepted as a personal key?</h2>
<p>This is about a theoretical attack. Thunderbird treats personal keys differently, it grants full trust to those keys, and we skip the usual acceptance question (verified, unverified, etc.).
</p><p>In theory, an attacker might create a key in the name of one of your contacts, send the secret key to you, and trick you to import it. By requiring you to confirm that a secret key is your own key, you will probably notice that it isn't a key in your name, and you will probably reject its use as your personal key. This stops the attack.
This setting is similar to GnuPG's model of setting key as having ""ownertrust ultimate"".
</p>
<h2 id=""w_why-is-encryption-automatically-enabled-when-i-reply-to-an-encrypted-message"">Why is encryption automatically enabled when I reply to an encrypted message?</h2>
<p>When replying, the default is to quote (include) the information that was in the message that you reply to. Your correspondent might have good reasons to encrypt their message, so you should be very careful when including the original text in a new message you send. It is advisable to continue using encryption. If you are unable to encrypt, and if you consider to reply without encryption, you should probably remove all the quoted text from the email message you are writing.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_how-do-i-get-the-public-keys-of-my-correspondents"">How do I get the public keys of my correspondents?</h2>
<p>If your correspondent sends you an email with their public key attached, or as a regular attachment, or contained in a hidden email header according to the Autocrypt standard, then Thunderbird will offer you to import the key.
</p><p>You may try to discover keys online by email address, by clicking on an email address in an email message you are reading, and using the command ""discover key"" shown in the popup menu. Currently, it will search for published keys using the WKD protocol, and it will search for keys in the <a href=""http://keys.openpgp.org"">keys.openpgp.org</a> keyserver. The same mechanism can be used from the OpenPGP Key Manager, using the Keyserver, ""Discover Keys Online"" command, which allows you to search by any email address or key ID or fingerprint. Also, the same discovery mechanism can be used when having attempted to send an encrypted email, and reviewing the missing key information.
If a key has been published on the Internet, you may download the key and use OpenPGP key manager to import the downloaded file. Or you may try to import by downloading from a given URL.
</p><p>Enigmail used to offer searching on non-verifying keyservers. At this time Thunderbird doesn't offer that, because of the various issues that were detected with those keyservers in the recent past. If you need to obtain a key from a keyserver that isn't currently supported by Thunderbird 78, then you must use other software to obtain it, then save it to a file, then you can use OpenPGP Key Manager to import the public key file.
</p><p>You can get the correspondent's public keys from other servers using the following gpg command:
</p><p>gpg --keyserver <a href=""http://pgp.key-server.io"">pgp.key-server.io</a> --armor --export PASTE_KEY_ID_HERE
</p><p>Copy the received public PGP key to clipboard and import it using OpenPGP Key Manager's Edit menu by selecting the ""Import Keys from Clipboard"" option.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_does-thunderbird-support-opportunistic-or-automatic-encryption"">Does Thunderbird support opportunistic or automatic encryption?</h2>
<p>No. At this time, Thunderbird requires the user to take control and decide when encryption should be used or not be used, by enabling the appropriate options when composing an email.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_i-had-configured-the-enigmail-add-on-to-trust-all-usable-keys-does-thunderbird-support-that"">I had configured the Enigmail add-on to trust all usable keys. Does Thunderbird support that?</h2>
<p>No. For each correspondent's public key that you want or need to use, Thunderbird 78 requires that you accept the key at least once.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_why-does-thunderbird-automatically-enable-the-digital-signature-when-i-enable-encryption"">Why does Thunderbird automatically enable the digital signature when I enable encryption?</h2>
<p>Message encryption by itself only provides confidentiality of content, but it doesn't provide reliable information about the actual sender of the message. In theory, someone could send you an encrypted message, but fake the sender of the email, giving you a false impression of trustworthy communication. Because an encrypted email without digital signature is not really secure, it is highly recommended to also digitally sign emails.
</p><p>Thunderbird currently does not offer an option to prevent digital signing from being enabled automatically. We might consider to offer this as a default configuration in the future. At this time, if you don't want to send a digital signature, you must manually disable this option prior to sending on each encrypted email that you send.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_why-does-thunderbird-automatically-send-my-public-key-whenever-i-digitally-sign-an-email"">Why does Thunderbird automatically send my public key whenever I digitally sign an email?</h2>
<p>The whole point of digitally signing a message is that the recipient will be able to verify that the digital signature is correct. A digital signature cannot be verified if the correspondent’s public key is unavailable. To ensure that your recipients will be able to verify your signature, it is best to always include your public key.
</p><p>You may manually disable the automatic attachment prior to sending the message.
</p><p>Thunderbird 91 and later allow you to disable the automatic attachment in account settings.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_my-public-key-is-very-big-because-i-have-many-signatures-on-it-it-is-too-big-to-include-it-with-every-signed-message"">My public key is very big, because I have many signatures on it. It is too big to include it with every signed message.</h2>
<p>Thunderbird 102 and later will automatically attach a reduced version of your key, which removes all certificates from other people.
</p><p>In Thunderbird 91 and before, we weren't able to automatically minimize your key. If you need to use an older version and want to avoid that your big key is sent with each digitally signed message, you could use other software, like GnuPG, to edit and minimize your key. Ensure you have a reliable backup of your secret key. Then export your key. Use other software to minimize it. Then delete your secret key in Thunderbird, import the minimized key, and ensure to adjust your account settings to use that key.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_i-used-an-advanced-configuration-with-gnupg-to-use-a-group-of-recipients-and-define-the-keys-to-be-used"">I used an advanced configuration with GnuPG to use a group of recipients and define the keys to be used.</h2>
<p>Thunderbird 91 and later support an alias mechanism, see the <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Aliases"">wiki page that explains how to use it</a>. In short, it is possible to maintain an external text file that defines which public keys should be used when creating encrypted email for certain email addresses or domains.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_does-thunderbird-support-per-recipient-rules-or-filter-rules-to-automatically-decrypt-emails"">Does Thunderbird support per recipient rules or filter rules to automatically decrypt emails?</h2>
<div class=""warning"">Please note: Thunderbird does <em>not</em> currently support per recipient rules or filter rules to automatically decrypt emails as in the Enigmail add-on. Please ensure that your encryption and digital signature settings apply as expected.</div>
<h2 id=""w_can-i-disable-the-encryption-of-the-email-subject"">Can I disable the encryption of the email subject?</h2>
<p>Yes, in Thunderbird 91 and later it is possible to disable it per message, or disable encrypted subjects by default in account settings.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_does-thunderbird-support-the-web-of-trust"">Does Thunderbird support the Web Of Trust?</h2>
<p>No. Thunderbird will not automatically trust or accept keys that were signed by others.
Also at this time, if you indicate that you have verified a correspondent's key, Thunderbird will not add your signature to it. This might change in a future version of Thunderbird.
</p><p>When using the Enigmail migration tool to migrate public keys to Thunderbird, it should detect keys that have already been signed by your personal key, and automatically mark the corresponding keys as accepted keys, so you don't need to start from scratch.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_how-does-thunderbird-store-which-keys-are-accepted"">How does Thunderbird store which keys are accepted?</h2>
<p>This information is stored in a file called openpgp.sqlite in the Thunderbird profile directory.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_where-does-thunderbird-store-openpgp-keys"">Where does Thunderbird store OpenPGP keys?</h2>
<p>It stores them in the Thunderbird profile directory.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_how-can-i-export-my-secret-or-public-key"">How can I export my secret or public key?</h2>
<p>Use the OpenPGP key manager, which you can find in the global Tools menu bar. Find the key that you would like to export and click it to select it. Then use the window's menu bar to open the File menu, and select either ""Export public key"" or ""Backup secret key"" depending on what you require.  The OpenPGP key manager also allows you to export public keys of your correspondents.
</p><p>Alternatively, open Account Settings for the email account of your key that you want to export and select the End-to-End Encryption pane. Next to each personal key is a little small chevron, which you can click to open key details. Click the More button to open a list of possible actions. Select either ""Export public key"" or ""Backup secret key"".
</p>
<h2 id=""w_i-need-to-use-both-gnupg-and-thunderbird-in-parallel-can-i-synchronize-my-keys"">I need to use both GnuPG and Thunderbird in parallel, can I synchronize my keys?</h2>
<p>No. At this time, Thunderbird uses its own copy of keys, and doesn't support synchronizing keys with GnuPG. The exception is the mechanism offered for smartcards, which could be used to use the personal keys managed by GnuPG.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_how-is-my-personal-key-protected"">How is my personal key protected?</h2>
<p>At the time you import your personal key into Thunderbird, we unlock it, and protect it with a different password, that is automatically (randomly) created. The same automatic password will be used for all OpenPGP secret keys managed by Thunderbird.
You should use the Thunderbird feature to set a Primary Password. Without a Primary Password, your OpenPGP keys in your profile directory are unprotected.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_does-thunderbird-support-autocrypt"">Does Thunderbird support Autocrypt?</h2>
<p>Thunderbird does not support the Autocrypt philosophy that encryption should be fully automatic. However, Thunderbird provides limited compatibility with email clients that support Autocrypt.
</p>
<ul><li> When sending an email and using the option to attach your OpenPGP public key, and your key is sufficiently simply to be compatible with Autocrypt, then Thunderbird will add the appropriate header in the outgoing email, which can allow your correspondent to learn about your public key.
</li><li> When receiving email that contains a correspondent's public key in an Autocrypt header, Thunderbird allows you to import the key.
</li><li> At this time, Thunderbird doesn't support the ""Gossip"" feature.
</li></ul>
<h2 id=""w_i-previously-used-enigmails-junior-mode-green-red-yellow-symbols-what-are-my-options"">I previously used Enigmail's Junior Mode (green, red, yellow symbols), what are my options?</h2>
<p>Enigmail for Thunderbird 68 had offered two very different modes of operation. A classic mode, which was described in settings as ""force using S/MIME and Enigmail"", and a ""junior mode"" which was implemented by software from the pEp software company. Note that Thunderbird is not affiliated with the pEp company.
</p><p>Thunderbird 78 does not provide the junior mode, the built-in OpenPGP feature that Thunderbird 78 provides is more similar to Enigmail's classic mode of operation. 
</p><p>When starting Thunderbird 78, after Enigmail has been upgraded to version 2.2.x (the version that provides migration assistance), Enigmail will open a web page provided by the pEp company, which offers you to download a newer version of their software.
</p><p>If you don't want to install pEp software, you may attempt a manual migration to Thunderbird's new built-in OpenPGP feature. To do so, you must set the configuration that disabled the previous Junior Mode.
Open the Thunderbird general settings, scroll to the bottom, open Config Editor, and search for ""extensions.enigmail.juniorMode"". Double click it to change it, and set the value to zero. This configuration change will cause the Enigmail migration tool to believe that you were previously using the Enigmail classic mode.
</p><p>Restart Thunderbird 78. After restarting, the Enigmail 2.2.x migration assistant will offer you to perform a migration of your keys. Because the Enigmail tool only migrates keys and settings that were managed using GnuPG, it cannot migrate the trust settings that were managed by pEp software. However, Enigmail should be able to migrate your personal keys, allowing you to decrypt the messages that are encrypted with that key. Enigmail should also be able to migrate the public keys of your correspondents. However, most or all correspondent keys will likely have the state ""not accepted"" in Thunderbird 78, so you will have to accept or verify them once when you're trying to use them.
</p><p>After restarting Thunderbird 78, if no migration offer is shown, then you need to access a command from the top menu bar. If you are using Windows or Linux, and the top menu bar isn't visible, use a mouse right click in the top area of the Thunderbird main window, and enable the menu bar. Then open the Tools menu, which contains the command ""Migrate Enigmail Settings"".

<p>As soon as you have started Thunderbird 78 with a profile, you cannot easily go back to 68, because the profile has been migrated, and Thunderbird 68 will refuse to use it, and will not start.
</p>
<ul><li> If you have a backup of your profile, you can try to restore it, then you should be able to start Thunderbird 68 again.
</li><li> If you don't have a backup, you could create Thunderbird 68 with a fresh profile and configure Thunderbird again.
</li><li> The use of the Thunderbird startup parameter --allow-downgrade is not recommended, because you will lose some configuration settings and may get unexpected behavior.

This feature is commonly known as end-to-end encryption (e2ee), and makes communications safer against being spied on by third parties. Thunderbird 78 has built-in support for two encryption standards, OpenPGP and S/MIME.

## What is end-to-end encryption about, and how does it work?

End-to-end encryption (e2ee) makes communications safer against being spied on by third parties. Please refer to the article [Introduction to End-to-end encryption in Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/introduction-to-e2e-encryption"") where we explain some of the basics.

## Does Thunderbird support OpenPGP?

Yes. Thunderbird 78 has built-in support for two encryption standards, OpenPGP and S/MIME. OpenPGP has been enabled by default since version 78.2.1.

Previous versions of Thunderbird (version 68 and before) had built-in S/MIME support, and it was possible to add OpenPGP support using the Enigmail add-on and GnuPG software. The Enigmail add-on is no longer available for Thunderbird 78 except to assist its former users with migrating to the built-in OpenPGP support or getting guidance how to restore their Enigmail “Junior Mode” user experience.

## Why was Enigmail replaced and will it come back?

The Enigmail add-on was replaced with built-in support for OpenPGP in Thunderbird 78.

This change was necessary because Thunderbird stopped supporting legacy add-ons, like Enigmail, in [Thunderbird 78](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/78.0/releasenotes/). The same change happened in [Firefox in 2017](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/11/23/add-ons-in-2017/). Thunderbird followed in 2020 because it is sharing Mozilla platform code with Firefox.

Enigmail will [not be further developped](https://enigmail.net/index.php/en/home/news/70-2019-10-08-future-openpgp-support-in-thunderbird) or migrated to other add-on technologies. About this change, Patrick Brunschwig, author of Enigmail, wrote:

_“It has always been my goal to have OpenPGP support included in the core Thunderbird product. Even though it will mark an end to a long story, after working on Enigmail for 17 years, I’m very happy with this outcome.”_

## Does OpenPGP in Thunderbird 78 look and work exactly like Enigmail?

No, there are several differences in the user interface and features offered. Thunderbird’s built-in OpenPGP support is _not_ an exact copy of Thunderbird with Enigmail. Thunderbird wants to offer a fully integrated solution, and is no longer using GnuPG by default to avoid licensing issues. This document explains the differences:  
[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Migration-From-Enigmail](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Migration-From-Enigmail)

## I have never used OpenPGP with Thunderbird before: How do I setup OpenPGP?

To use OpenPGP functionality in Thunderbird, you need to set a so-called personal key pair for your email address. You can do that in the End-to-End Encryption subsection of your account settings. If you have already used OpenPGP with other software, you need to import a backup copy of your existing key. Otherwise, you can create a new key.

- ≡ \> Account Settings \> _select your account_ \> End-to-End Encryption \> Add Key…
  - If you already have a personal OpenPGP key pair from another software, choose Import an existing PGP key.
  - If you don't have a key yet, choose Create a New OpenPGP key.
- After importing or creating it, while still in account settings, select the key you want to actively use with your email account.

Note that using OpenPGP has consequences as explained in the general introduction. It is important to make a backup of your key and store it in a secure location, separate from your regular computer.

## I have previously used Enigmail, how do I migrate and configure?

You can upgrade your Thunderbird settings from an older version (such as 68.x) to version 78.x It is recommended that you make a backup of your old Thunderbird profile before you use Thunderbird 78 for the first time, because once you have upgraded, your profile can no longer be used with Thunderbird 68. If for any reason you decide that you must continue to use Thunderbird 68 and Enigmail, a backup will allow you to go back easily.

Enigmail is currently available in two versions, 2.1.x and 2.2.x:

- Enigmail 2.1.x only works with Thunderbird 68 and older release versions, and provides the classic functionality. 
- Enigmail version 2.2.x is a specially modified version, which only works with Thunderbird 78 and later version. Enigmail 2.2.x doesn't provide the traditional functionality, rather it exists to help you migrate your keys and settings to Thunderbird 78.

If you start Thunderbird 78 with an existing profile, and the previous profile had Enigmail installed, then Thunderbird 78 will detect that the previous Enigmail 2.1.x Add-on is not compatible. It should automatically check for a newer version, it will find Enigmail 2.2.x and install it. Then Enigmail will automatically open a tab that greets you and explains that migration is possible, and offers to start it.

Enigmail was using GnuPG to store and manage all keys and trust settings. If you click the button to start the migration, the Enigmail migration software will read your old keys from GnuPG one after the other. You must enter passwords to confirm the export of your keys from GnuPG and to allow them to be unlocked for importing them into Thunderbird's new internal key storage.

Thunderbird 78 uses different settings than Enigmail. With Enigmail, it was possible to enable OpenPGP for an email account, but let it automatically select which of your keys would be used. Thunderbird 78 combines these settings. To enable OpenPGP for an email account, it is necessary to explicitly specify which personal key to use.

Consequently, if you had previously used the automatic selection, then the migration might not have selected a key yet. After the migration, you should manually check the configuration of all your email accounts and identities, and if necessary, manually select the appropriate key.

## The Enigmail migration has completed successfully, but I'm still unable to use OpenPGP.

If you had Enigmail enabled for an email account on Thunderbird 68, and you enabled the preference ""Use email address of this identity to identify OpenPGP key"", then OpenPGP may not be enabled automatically in Thunderbird 78. You need to use account settings to manually select an OpenPGP key for every account and identity which you want to use with OpenPGP. Unfortunately, Enigmail migration does not automatically select them for you.

## Can I repeat the migration?

Note that migration requires the use of Thunderbird 78.x. Using Thunderbird 91 and later, the migration Add-on is no longer available. If you still need to upgrade from Thunderbird 68 or older, you could manually download Thunderbird 78 to perform the migration, then upgrade to the latest Thunderbird version afterwards.

If there is any problem with the migration with Thunderbird 78.x, you can repeat it. For example, the migration may fail if you experience a bug in Thunderbird, or if you did not remember the password for all of your personal keys, and did only a partial migration. To repeat the migration, you need to access a command from the top menu bar. If you are using Windows or Linux, and the top menu bar isn't visible, use a mouse right click in the top area of the Thunderbird main window, and enable the menu bar. Then use the Tools menu, which contains the command ""Migrate Enigmail Settings"".

## I tried to import a file with public keys, and I get an error message that the file is too big.

Please see the answer to the following question.

## I previously used OpenPGP with GnuPG, but with a different email software. How can I migrate my keys to Thunderbird 78?

You need to first export your keys from the other software and then re-import them to Thunderbird.

As a way of exporting your personal keys (also called private or secret keys), you could use a command from command prompt to export them to a file. To export keys managed by GnuPG, you could use the following command:

gpg --export-secret-keys --armor \> my-secret-keys.asc

Then you can import them into Thunderbird. Either use the Add Key and Import functionality in Thunderbird account settings, end-to-end encryption. Or use the global menu bar to open the Tools menu which offers the OpenPGP Key Manager. Use File Import Secret Keys and select the file you have created above. (Both import methods work with secret/private keys, only.) You probably have only a small amount of personal keys, therefore this approach should work.

You may use a similar approach for exporting the public keys of your correspondents and use the following command:

gpg --export --armor \> all-public-keys.asc

However, if you have many keys, you might experience a problem because of a current limitation in Thunderbird. Currently, Thunderbird cannot import a large set of keys in a single step. An attempt to import a file that is bigger than 5 MB will be rejected.

You have two options to work around this limitation.

- The first option is to use a graphical key manager for GnuPG and export your keys into separate files. For example, if all public keys in total have a size of 17 MB, you would have to create 4 files, and select a quarter of public keys for each exported file. This is a bit cumbersome.
- Alternatively, you could try to use the Enigmail version 2.2.x migration Add-on for importing public keys into Thunderbird, even if you haven't used Enigmail before.

To do so, use Thunderbird 78 and search for the Enigmail Add-on. You will be offered to install version 2.2.x. Once installed, you can manually access the command ""Migrate Enigmail Settings"" from Thunderbird's top menu bar, in the Tools submenu. Note that this may fail, depending on how you have set up GnuPG software on your computer, so it cannot be guaranteed that this approach works.

If GnuPG software has been correctly installed on your computer, the Enigmail migration Add-on will find it and import all public keys from GnuPG into Thunderbird one by one, without being affected by the above-mentioned sized limit.

## Enigmail reports that migration of my private key has failed.

This could mean that you were trying to import a key that is not yet supported by RNP. Another possible reason is an incomplete setup of GnuPG software on your computer, especially if you were not prompted to enter a password to export your private key – this shouldn't apply if you have recently successfully used Enigmail on your computer.

A good way to ensure that you have correctly installed GnuPG is to use the following procedure:

- Install Thunderbird 68 into a separate directory, then run Thunderbird 68 with parameter -P and run it with a separate profile. (You don't need to configure an email account, you may cancel that suggestion.)
- Then install Enigmail into your Thunderbird 68 profile, and execute the Enigmail setup wizard, which will help you to setup GnuPG software correctly.

If this didn't help, you could check the Enigmail FAQ: [https://enigmail.net/index.php/en/faq-en?view=topic&id=14](https://enigmail.net/index.php/en/faq-en?view=topic&id=14)

## What types of OpenPGP keys are supported?

Please note: Thunderbird uses the RNP software for processing keys, which may not yet support certain types of keys. This means that certain keys which are supported by GnuPG / Enigmail may not work with Thunderbird 78 by default, especially some keys with an advanced structure. **However, for private keys, you might solve the problem by configuring Thunderbird to use GnuPG** , as explained in the next section.

For private keys that are stored on a smartcard, please see the separate section about smartcard support.

Thunderbird 91 and later supports importing and using OpenPGP personal keys with an offline primary key. The term offline means that the secret key for the primary key is intentionally absent. Note that Thunderbird itself doesn't support creating such a key, it's necessary to use external OpenPGP software (e.g. GnuPG) to create this key configuration, which could then be exported from GnuPG, and then imported into Thunderbird.

**The following keys are _not_ or _not yet_ supported by Thunderbird _by default_:**
- Certain keys that are incomplete, for example those using an offline primary key.
- Keys that use a different password for a sub key
- Keys located on a smartcard.
- Keys using the MD5 hash algorithm.
- Certain other keys that RNP may not yet support.
If you find that a key does not work with Thunderbird, please report it! If possible, and only if it is a public key, please include a copy of the key. **Please be careful and never send us your secret/private keys!**

**Keys using SHA-1 hashes** Thunderbird 91.8 attempted to deprecate OpenPGP keys that contain properties that were signed using the SHA-1 has algorithm, but the change was reverted, as too many users were negatively affected. More details about the deprecation plan can be found in this blog post: [https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/05/openpgp-keys-and-sha-1/](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/05/openpgp-keys-and-sha-1/) .

## I have imported my secret key, but Thunderbird cannot decrypt my emails.

Maybe you imported the wrong key? To check that you have really imported the right key, you can do the following:

1. In Thunderbird, click on a message that you think you should be able to decrypt, but cannot decrypt.
2. Use ≡ \> Save As \> File and save your message to a file on disk (e.g. /tmp/test.eml).
3. Open a terminal. Run this command: **gpg --list-packets /tmp/test.eml**  
You should get a listing of key IDs that can be used to decrypt the message (encrypted with ... ID ...).
4. Now go back to Thunderbird: ≡ \> Tools \> OpenPGP Key Manager.
5. For each of the secret keys that you have available (listed as bold), double-click to view key properties, then click on the structure tab.

Can you find the ID that was shown above by _gpg_? You need to have the secret keys for at least one of the IDs that were shown by _gpg_. If you do not have any matching secret key, then you cannot decrypt the message. If you _do_ have a matching secret, but Thunderbird still fails to decrypt the message, please [report a bug against Thunderbird](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=MailNews%20Core&component=Security%3A%20OpenPGP) with more details about your key.

## If my secret key isn't supported by Thunderbird, what can I do?

Thunderbird 78 allows you to optionally set up the external software called GnuPG for handling your secret keys (for digital signing and decryption of received messages). This will enable the use of smartcards or hardware tokens that store a secret key. You may also use it for keys that are stored in files on your computer and are not supported by Thunderbird’s built-in OpenPGP implementation.

You need to install and configure the required GnuPG software yourself, because it cannot be distributed together with Thunderbird. Therefore this mechanism isn't enabled by default. To learn how to use it, please refer to the next question about smartcards.

Note that public keys and their acceptance settings (for encryption and signature verification) are always handled by Thunderbird's internal code.

## Can I use an OpenPGP smartcard or a hardware token with Thunderbird 78?

Yes, we offer an optional mechanism. It requires that you install GnuPG and all required software yourself. Please refer to this document for more details:[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Smartcards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Smartcards)

## How do I send an encrypted or digitally signed email?

Ensure that you have configured your personal key for your email account or identity. When you write an email, use the Options menu, or the menu found on the security button, and enable the protection you would like to use.

## What is needed to send an encrypted message?

- You must have your personal key set up and selected.
- You must have an accepted public key for every recipient of an encrypted message which you want to send. Public keys are often attached to the email messages of your correspondents. There is more information on getting public keys from others in another section of this document.
- You must verify that the public keys of your correspondents really belong to them. If you accept someone’s public key without verifying it, you will be exposing your communication to Monster In The Middle attacks (MITM).
- If you don't have a public key for every recipient, sending of your message will be blocked, and Thunderbird will alert you. You can choose between not sending the message at all, or disabling encryption and sending the message without protection, or only send the message to the subset of recipients for who you do have public keys.

## What does key acceptance mean?

Technically, anyone is able to create an OpenPGP key in anyone's name, using any email address they want. Nobody is able to limit or prevent that. This means, whenever you receive a correspondent's public key, you risk that it is a false key, and an attempt to trick you. Unless you have verified your correspondent's key, you might not be having a confidential conversation, but rather you might be the victim of a Monster-In-The-Middle attack (MITM). It is your decision if you care about this attack vector, and you might want to decide individually based on the correspondent.

If you accept a key, it means you are willing to use that key for sending encrypted messages to that correspondent. If you receive an email from a correspondent, your acceptance decision controls how the digital signature will be displayed. Only signatures from accepted keys will be shown as valid.

## Why do I have to mark my own secret key as accepted as a personal key?

This is about a theoretical attack. Thunderbird treats personal keys differently, it grants full trust to those keys, and we skip the usual acceptance question (verified, unverified, etc.).

In theory, an attacker might create a key in the name of one of your contacts, send the secret key to you, and trick you to import it. By requiring you to confirm that a secret key is your own key, you will probably notice that it isn't a key in your name, and you will probably reject its use as your personal key. This stops the attack. This setting is similar to GnuPG's model of setting key as having ""ownertrust ultimate"".

## Why is encryption automatically enabled when I reply to an encrypted message?

When replying, the default is to quote (include) the information that was in the message that you reply to. Your correspondent might have good reasons to encrypt their message, so you should be very careful when including the original text in a new message you send. It is advisable to continue using encryption. If you are unable to encrypt, and if you consider to reply without encryption, you should probably remove all the quoted text from the email message you are writing.

## How do I get the public keys of my correspondents?

If your correspondent sends you an email with their public key attached, or as a regular attachment, or contained in a hidden email header according to the Autocrypt standard, then Thunderbird will offer you to import the key.

You may try to discover keys online by email address, by clicking on an email address in an email message you are reading, and using the command ""discover key"" shown in the popup menu. Currently, it will search for published keys using the WKD protocol, and it will search for keys in the [keys.openpgp.org](http://keys.openpgp.org) keyserver. The same mechanism can be used from the OpenPGP Key Manager, using the Keyserver, ""Discover Keys Online"" command, which allows you to search by any email address or key ID or fingerprint. Also, the same discovery mechanism can be used when having attempted to send an encrypted email, and reviewing the missing key information. If a key has been published on the Internet, you may download the key and use OpenPGP key manager to import the downloaded file. Or you may try to import by downloading from a given URL.

Enigmail used to offer searching on non-verifying keyservers. At this time Thunderbird doesn't offer that, because of the various issues that were detected with those keyservers in the recent past. If you need to obtain a key from a keyserver that isn't currently supported by Thunderbird 78, then you must use other software to obtain it, then save it to a file, then you can use OpenPGP Key Manager to import the public key file.

You can get the correspondent's public keys from other servers using the following gpg command:

gpg --keyserver [pgp.key-server.io](http://pgp.key-server.io) --armor --export PASTE\_KEY\_ID\_HERE

Copy the received public PGP key to clipboard and import it using OpenPGP Key Manager's Edit menu by selecting the ""Import Keys from Clipboard"" option.

## Does Thunderbird support opportunistic or automatic encryption?

No. At this time, Thunderbird requires the user to take control and decide when encryption should be used or not be used, by enabling the appropriate options when composing an email.

## I had configured the Enigmail add-on to trust all usable keys. Does Thunderbird support that?

No. For each correspondent's public key that you want or need to use, Thunderbird 78 requires that you accept the key at least once.

## Why does Thunderbird automatically enable the digital signature when I enable encryption?

Message encryption by itself only provides confidentiality of content, but it doesn't provide reliable information about the actual sender of the message. In theory, someone could send you an encrypted message, but fake the sender of the email, giving you a false impression of trustworthy communication. Because an encrypted email without digital signature is not really secure, it is highly recommended to also digitally sign emails.

Thunderbird currently does not offer an option to prevent digital signing from being enabled automatically. We might consider to offer this as a default configuration in the future. At this time, if you don't want to send a digital signature, you must manually disable this option prior to sending on each encrypted email that you send.

## Why does Thunderbird automatically send my public key whenever I digitally sign an email?

The whole point of digitally signing a message is that the recipient will be able to verify that the digital signature is correct. A digital signature cannot be verified if the correspondent’s public key is unavailable. To ensure that your recipients will be able to verify your signature, it is best to always include your public key.

You may manually disable the automatic attachment prior to sending the message.

Thunderbird 91 and later allow you to disable the automatic attachment in account settings.

## My public key is very big, because I have many signatures on it. It is too big to include it with every signed message.

Thunderbird 102 and later will automatically attach a reduced version of your key, which removes all certificates from other people.

In Thunderbird 91 and before, we weren't able to automatically minimize your key. If you need to use an older version and want to avoid that your big key is sent with each digitally signed message, you could use other software, like GnuPG, to edit and minimize your key. Ensure you have a reliable backup of your secret key. Then export your key. Use other software to minimize it. Then delete your secret key in Thunderbird, import the minimized key, and ensure to adjust your account settings to use that key.

## I used an advanced configuration with GnuPG to use a group of recipients and define the keys to be used.

Thunderbird 91 and later support an alias mechanism, see the [wiki page that explains how to use it](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Aliases). In short, it is possible to maintain an external text file that defines which public keys should be used when creating encrypted email for certain email addresses or domains.

## Does Thunderbird support per recipient rules or filter rules to automatically decrypt emails?

Please note: Thunderbird does _not_ currently support per recipient rules or filter rules to automatically decrypt emails as in the Enigmail add-on. Please ensure that your encryption and digital signature settings apply as expected.

## Can I disable the encryption of the email subject?

Yes, in Thunderbird 91 and later it is possible to disable it per message, or disable encrypted subjects by default in account settings.

## Does Thunderbird support the Web Of Trust?

No. Thunderbird will not automatically trust or accept keys that were signed by others. Also at this time, if you indicate that you have verified a correspondent's key, Thunderbird will not add your signature to it. This might change in a future version of Thunderbird.

When using the Enigmail migration tool to migrate public keys to Thunderbird, it should detect keys that have already been signed by your personal key, and automatically mark the corresponding keys as accepted keys, so you don't need to start from scratch.

## How does Thunderbird store which keys are accepted?

This information is stored in a file called openpgp.sqlite in the Thunderbird profile directory.

## Where does Thunderbird store OpenPGP keys?

It stores them in the Thunderbird profile directory.

## How can I export my secret or public key?

Use the OpenPGP key manager, which you can find in the global Tools menu bar. Find the key that you would like to export and click it to select it. Then use the window's menu bar to open the File menu, and select either ""Export public key"" or ""Backup secret key"" depending on what you require. The OpenPGP key manager also allows you to export public keys of your correspondents.

Alternatively, open Account Settings for the email account of your key that you want to export and select the End-to-End Encryption pane. Next to each personal key is a little small chevron, which you can click to open key details. Click the More button to open a list of possible actions. Select either ""Export public key"" or ""Backup secret key"".

## I need to use both GnuPG and Thunderbird in parallel, can I synchronize my keys?

No. At this time, Thunderbird uses its own copy of keys, and doesn't support synchronizing keys with GnuPG. The exception is the mechanism offered for smartcards, which could be used to use the personal keys managed by GnuPG.

## How is my personal key protected?

At the time you import your personal key into Thunderbird, we unlock it, and protect it with a different password, that is automatically (randomly) created. The same automatic password will be used for all OpenPGP secret keys managed by Thunderbird. You should use the Thunderbird feature to set a Primary Password. Without a Primary Password, your OpenPGP keys in your profile directory are unprotected.

## Does Thunderbird support Autocrypt?

Thunderbird does not support the Autocrypt philosophy that encryption should be fully automatic. However, Thunderbird provides limited compatibility with email clients that support Autocrypt.

- When sending an email and using the option to attach your OpenPGP public key, and your key is sufficiently simply to be compatible with Autocrypt, then Thunderbird will add the appropriate header in the outgoing email, which can allow your correspondent to learn about your public key.
- When receiving email that contains a correspondent's public key in an Autocrypt header, Thunderbird allows you to import the key.
- At this time, Thunderbird doesn't support the ""Gossip"" feature.

## I previously used Enigmail's Junior Mode (green, red, yellow symbols), what are my options?

Enigmail for Thunderbird 68 had offered two very different modes of operation. A classic mode, which was described in settings as ""force using S/MIME and Enigmail"", and a ""junior mode"" which was implemented by software from the pEp software company. Note that Thunderbird is not affiliated with the pEp company.

Thunderbird 78 does not provide the junior mode, the built-in OpenPGP feature that Thunderbird 78 provides is more similar to Enigmail's classic mode of operation.

When starting Thunderbird 78, after Enigmail has been upgraded to version 2.2.x (the version that provides migration assistance), Enigmail will open a web page provided by the pEp company, which offers you to download a newer version of their software.

If you don't want to install pEp software, you may attempt a manual migration to Thunderbird's new built-in OpenPGP feature. To do so, you must set the configuration that disabled the previous Junior Mode. Open the Thunderbird general settings, scroll to the bottom, open Config Editor, and search for ""extensions.enigmail.juniorMode"". Double click it to change it, and set the value to zero. This configuration change will cause the Enigmail migration tool to believe that you were previously using the Enigmail classic mode.

Restart Thunderbird 78. After restarting, the Enigmail 2.2.x migration assistant will offer you to perform a migration of your keys. Because the Enigmail tool only migrates keys and settings that were managed using GnuPG, it cannot migrate the trust settings that were managed by pEp software. However, Enigmail should be able to migrate your personal keys, allowing you to decrypt the messages that are encrypted with that key. Enigmail should also be able to migrate the public keys of your correspondents. However, most or all correspondent keys will likely have the state ""not accepted"" in Thunderbird 78, so you will have to accept or verify them once when you're trying to use them.

After restarting Thunderbird 78, if no migration offer is shown, then you need to access a command from the top menu bar. If you are using Windows or Linux, and the top menu bar isn't visible, use a mouse right click in the top area of the Thunderbird main window, and enable the menu bar. Then open the Tools menu, which contains the command ""Migrate Enigmail Settings"".

## I am using Enigmail 2.2.x to perform a migration, but the import appears stuck.

Maybe the software has run into a problem. Please refer to the section about obtaining more information on failure.

## Where can I ask questions about, or report problems with the OpenPGP feature?

If your problem isn't covered on this page or in the linked documents, please refer to section ""Discussion"" on the following page for ways to contact us:[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP#Discussion](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP#Discussion)

## How can I check if the problem I have has already been reported?

Please refer to section ""Open issues and TODO list"" here:[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP#Open\_issues\_and\_TODO\_list](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP#Open_issues_and_TODO_list)

## I am seeing a problem and I want to try and analyze it myself.

More information can be found here in section ""Debugging / Tracing"":[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP#Debugging\_.2F\_Tracing](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP#Debugging_.2F_Tracing)

## Thunderbird was automatically upgraded to version 78, but I prefer to stay with Thunderbird 68 and Enigmail.

As soon as you have started Thunderbird 78 with a profile, you cannot easily go back to 68, because the profile has been migrated, and Thunderbird 68 will refuse to use it, and will not start.

- If you have a backup of your profile, you can try to restore it, then you should be able to start Thunderbird 68 again.
- If you don't have a backup, you could create Thunderbird 68 with a fresh profile and configure Thunderbird again.
- The use of the Thunderbird startup parameter --allow-downgrade is not recommended, because you will lose some configuration settings and may get unexpected behavior.

## I received an encrypted email with a hidden recipient (key ID 0x00000000) and Thunderbird cannot decrypt it.

This is not yet supported. The addition of the feature is tracked here:[https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/issues/1275](https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/issues/1275)

</li><li> The <em>Developer Tools</em> window is shown.
</li><li> Current versions of Thunderbird will show the <strong>Performance</strong> tab with <span class=""button"">Start recording</span> shown.  If you do not see that tab, then press <span class=""key"">F1</span>, or click on the <span class=""button"">•••</span> button in the top-right corner, then click on <span class=""menu"">Settings</span>. Ensure that <span class=""menu"">[✓] Performance</span> is checked. Then click on the <span class=""menu"">Performance</span> tab that has appeared at the top of the toolbox.
</li><li> <strong>Configure profiler settings:</strong>
<ol><li> Click ""edit settings"" which is the last item in the Developer Tools window. 
</li><li> Select the ""Thunderbird"" preset, if it isn't already. (If you are using nightly/trunk builds, select the ""Daily"" preset.)
</li><li> Scroll down and also mark the checkbox for ""All File IO"". 
</li><li> Change any other settings that might be needed. For example, if you expect to need a very long sample, longer than a minute, you might need to increase the buffer size from 1GB to 2GB, or reduce the sample interval to less than 1ms.
</li><li> Close the settings window.
</li></ol>

You will only need to refer to the [Firefox profiler documentation](https://profiler.firefox.com/docs/#/) if you have trouble or want to do something special, such as profiling startup performance. In the documentation, anywhere 'Firefox' is mentioned, think 'Thunderbird'.

**Note:** None of your private information is shared by default. Performance profiles which you capture and chose to share publicly do NOT contain personally identifiable nor private information unless you explicitly opt in to sharing such additional information.

# Step 1 - Preparing performance recording in Thunderbird

The performance recorder is part of the _Developer Toolbox_ in Thunderbird.

Before you start your recording, prepare as much as possible the scenario which you want to test in Thunderbird.

1. In Thunderbird’s main window, open the _Developer Toolbox_: Press Ctrl + Shift + ICommand + Shift + I, _ **or** _ click on ≡ \> Tools \> Developer Tools \> Developer Toolbox.
2. **Important: Confirm the warning prompt _Incoming Connection ... Allow connection?_ with OK** so that the toolbox can connect to your Thunderbird application. Note: The prompt might be hidden behind other Thunderbird windows.
3. The _Developer Tools_ window is shown.
4. Current versions of Thunderbird will show the **Performance** tab with Start recording shown. If you do not see that tab, then press F1, or click on the ••• button in the top-right corner, then click on Settings. Ensure that [✓] Performance is checked. Then click on the Performance tab that has appeared at the top of the toolbox.
5. **Configure profiler settings:**
  1. Click ""edit settings"" which is the last item in the Developer Tools window. 
  2. Select the ""Thunderbird"" preset, if it isn't already. (If you are using nightly/trunk builds, select the ""Daily"" preset.)
  3. Scroll down and also mark the checkbox for ""All File IO"". 
  4. Change any other settings that might be needed. For example, if you expect to need a very long sample, longer than a minute, you might need to increase the buffer size from 1GB to 2GB, or reduce the sample interval to less than 1ms.
  5. Close the settings window.
6. Important: Before starting your performance recording, go back to the main Thunderbird window, and finish preparing the performance scenario to be recorded.

# Step 2 - Recording a performance profile

You are now ready to record and save the performance profile of your scenario. Unless told otherwise, try to keep your recording as short as possible by recording only the exact set of actions which are suspected to cause the problem.

1. In the Performance tab of the _Developer Tools_ window, click on the Start Recording button.
2. Without delay, go back to the main Thunderbird window and perform the set of actions you want to record.
3. Once finished, immediately select Stop Recording in the _Developer Tools_ window.

# Step 3 - Saving and sharing a performance profile

1. Click Capture recording to finish the collection process and you will briefly see **Capturing profile** , ending with a Firefox Profiler window. If you did not see the capture button then you are using an older version of Thunderbird ad profiler. Skip to the section on [Old Versions of Thunderbird](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiling-thunderbird-performance#w_old-versions-of-thunderbird). 
2. Click Upload local Profile. For the profile which you are preparing to share, check the boxes for items which you wish to share your private information. 
**Note:** The profile does NOT contain personally identifiable nor private information unless you explicitly opt in to sharing such additional information.
3. Scroll down if necessary to do Download for saving a local json file, or Upload to send the profile to a repository at [https://profiler.firefox.com/](https://profiler.firefox.com/). **Upload** will provide a permalink in the form of https://share.firefox.dev/ which you can copy and share with developers and others who might help you with your problem.
4. Close the Performance Profiler window.
5. Close the Developers Tools window.

## Old versions of Thunderbird

Older versions of Thunderbird require some manual steps to save the profile.

1. On the left side, right next to the new _Recording #1_ item, click the **Save** link and save the file to somewhere on your computer. The file extension must be _.json_.
2. Go to [https://profiler.firefox.com/](https://profiler.firefox.com/) (yes, on [firefox.com](http://firefox.com)).
3. Select Load a profile from file and select the _.json_ file which you just saved for upload.
4. **Important: Near the top-right, select the green Publish button** , then in the _Share Performance Profile_ panel, select the (blue) Publish button again.
5. Copy the link (e.g. https://share.firefox.dev/1XYZXYz) which pops up in the top-right corner under the new permalink button and paste it into an appropriate [new bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Thunderbird) or existing bug on [Bugzilla (BMO)](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org).
6. Finally, back in the _Developer Tools_ Performance tab, you can delete the performance profile using the **trash-icon** just above the profile list in the left-top corner (where you saved the profile), and then close the _Developer Tools_ window.

# Profiling Thunderbird startup and shutdown

Profiling startup or shutdown involves [special, but very simple instructions](https://profiler.firefox.com/docs/#/./guide-startup-shutdown). Again, where 'Firefox' is mentioned, think 'Thunderbird'.

<h1 id=""w_exchange-messages-with-programs-other-than-thunderbird"">Exchange messages with programs other than Thunderbird</h1>
<p>The extension could send messages to and receive them from a complementary native app on your computer.
</p><p>The complementary app needs to be installed on your computer independently of the extension. This usually happens in one of two ways:
</p>
<ul><li> The extension will provide a guide to the steps you should follow to install the app
</li><li> You would have installed an app that then suggests you install an extension in Thunderbird
</li></ul>
<p>Please note that the Thunderbird Team has not vetted or reviewed the complementary app. You should approach the installation of the complementary app with the same caution you would apply when installing any third party software from the internet.

</p><p>Extensions requesting this permission might:
</p>
<ul><li> Offer features to use securely encrypted single sign-on mechanisms

![Permission request for Thunderbird extensions](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif)

This is an extension asking your permission to tap into Thunderbird’s inner framework (via APIs) to alter its behavior. These APIs might ask to access your configured mail accounts, your messages, your contacts and your calendar data or alter settings in your profile. If you don't see one of these messages that means the extension won't try to access any of your data or change any of your settings.

This article provides details about each of the messages, to help you understand the practical impact on your data and the behaviour of Thunderbird.

(You are also encouraged to check out Mozilla’s [Tips for assessing the safety of an extension](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tips-assessing-safety-extension"") for further guidance on evaluating extensions. It refers to the Firefox add-on portal at [addons.mozilla.org](http://addons.mozilla.org), but the article applies to [addons.thunderbird.net](http://addons.thunderbird.net) as well)

# Have full, unrestricted access to Thunderbird, and your computer

The extension is using an older technology and has full access to Thunderbird’s internal APIs and does not need to request individual permissions. Up to Thunderbird 68 almost every add-on had this unrestricted access without specifically asking for it. Add-ons request this permission, as long as the new permission based API system does not yet offer the functionality they need.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Change every aspect of Thunderbird’s user interface
- Read and modify all your data (messages, contacts, calendars, web content and passwords)
- Read, modify and execute any file on your computer

Add-ons published to [addons.thunderbird.net](http://addons.thunderbird.net) (ATN) are subject to human review. If you install extensions from other locations, you have to be sure that you can trust the source.

# See your mail accounts and their folders

This extension can list all mail accounts configured in your Thunderbird profile and all of their folders.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Add colored elements to the message compose window as a visual indication of the used account.

# Create, rename, or delete your mail account folders

This extension can add, rename or delete a folder within one of your configured mail accounts.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Offer ways to help users organizing their messages by automatically managing their folders

# Read and modify your address books and contacts

This extension can read and modify all address books configured in your Thunderbird profile and all of their contacts.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Offer ways to synchronize address books and contacts with remote servers

# Read and modify your email messages as you compose and send them

This extension has access to the content of the message compose window while a new message is being created and can modify its appearance and all related information including the typed message, the recipient addresses, the subject and the attachments.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Remove all images from the reply body
- Offer ways to insert predefined blocks of text

# Read your email messages and mark or tag them

This extension can read all messages stored in Thunderbird. This also includes any related information like sender, recipient and attachments.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Evaluate sender information
- Offer ways to store additional notes per message

# Read and modify your email messages as they are displayed to you

This extension can modify the content and the appearance of a message as it is displayed to you. The message is not permanently modified.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Add thumbnails into the message identifying the sender
- Change links in the message to be pre-processed by a proxy server

# Move, copy, or delete your email messages

This extension can delete your messages. If this extension also has permission to see your mail accounts and their folders, it can also move or copy your messages to other folders.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Offer ways to help users organizing their messages by moving them into folders

# Access your data for all websites

The extension can read the content of any web page you visit as well as data you enter into those web pages, such as usernames and passwords.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Read product and price information from a page to help find you the best price on items you are shopping for
- Offer a password manager that reads and writes details of your username and password

# Access your data for sites in the “named” domain

The extension could read the content of web pages you visit in the specified domain, as well as data you enter into those web pages, such as usernames and passwords.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Update the look of some or all pages within the domain
- Block content, such as advertising or content using certain tags, from a domain’s content feed

# Access your data in # other domains

Used in conjunction with the named domain message (above) when the extension is requesting access to five or more domains; the first three are listed and the other domain requests counted.

# Access your data for “named site”

The extension could read the content of any web pages you visit at the specified website, as well as any data you enter into those web pages, such as usernames and passwords.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Update the look of some or all pages within the website
- Block content, such as advertising or content labeled with certain tags

# Access your data on # other sites

Used in conjunction with the named website message (above) when the extension is requesting access to five or more websites—the first three are listed and the other website requests counted.

# Exchange messages with programs other than Thunderbird

The extension could send messages to and receive them from a complementary native app on your computer.

The complementary app needs to be installed on your computer independently of the extension. This usually happens in one of two ways:

- The extension will provide a guide to the steps you should follow to install the app
- You would have installed an app that then suggests you install an extension in Thunderbird

Please note that the Thunderbird Team has not vetted or reviewed the complementary app. You should approach the installation of the complementary app with the same caution you would apply when installing any third party software from the internet.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Use a complementary app to communicate with hardware attached to your computer
- Store usernames and passwords using a secure method not available to Thunderbird
- Perform extensive computations in a complimentary app

# Read and modify profile settings

The extension could do one or more of the following:

- Enable or disable the display of popups
- Enable or disable the caching of web pages
- Disable notifications
- Prompt for all new requests to display notifications
- Read the URL used in new tabs
- Determine how the Thunderbird displays animated images—plays as normal, once, or not at all

# Clear recent browsing history, cookies, and related data

Extensions requesting this permission might offer enhanced features to clean up your browsing history.

The extension could clear any or all of:

- Browser cache
- Cookies
- Downloads
- History
- Local storage
- Saved form data
- Saved passwords

# Get data from the clipboard

The extension could retrieve data from the clipboard: The equivalent of ""paste"".

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Let you submit copied text into a translation tool
- Use a copied image to perform a lookup in a visual search engine

# Input data to the clipboard

The extension could write data to the clipboard: The equivalent of “copy” or “cut”.

Extensions requesting this permission might add content to the clipboard so you can use it elsewhere in Thunderbird or on your computer.

# Access IP address and hostname information

When you visit a website, you generally see or entered the hostname (e.g. [amazon.com](http://amazon.com)). A service called DNS transforms the hostname into an IP address, a number that identifies the device connecting to the network. This is also true for devices in your local work or home network. This permission enables the extension to transform hostnames into IP addresses.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Use information about your current location
- Determine if you are on a local network, and gather information about it

# Download files and read and modify Thunderbird’s download history

The extension could save a file from the web or one created in the extension using Thunderbird’s download manager. The extension could also access and update details of downloaded files stored in the download manager.

Note: The extension has to obey the settings in the download manager, putting you in control of where the files are saved.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Save data from the extension to your computer (extensions are not allowed to write directly to your computer’s file system) 
- Save files from a website or remote server
- Provide a feature to manage download history

# Open files downloaded to your computer

The extension could request that the application on your computer that handles files of a specific type opens a downloaded file. For example, if you have Microsoft Word installed on your computer, the extension could request it to open file with "".docx"".

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Open audio files in your computer’s music player
- Open documents, images, or other files in an editor

# Access your location

The extension could obtain your location from your computer, GPS, the location associated with your IP address, or some other method.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Provide information about your current location
- Record your location with data maintained in the extension

# Monitor extension usage and manage themes

The extension could:

- Get information about installed add-ons (extensions and themes)
- Enable and disable themes
- Uninstall itself
- Get notifications of add-ons being installed, uninstalled, enabled, or disabled

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Monitor add-on installation to check for any potential conflicts
- Change or manage themes

# Display notifications to you

The extension could issue notifications through the standard notifications system offered by your computer’s operating systems.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Alert you to the completion of background or long-running tasks in the extension
- Aggregate messages from one or more web services

# Provide cryptographic authentication services

The extension could access software on your computer for generating and validating security keys and certificates using the PKCS #11 standard. (Note the extension cannot install the PKCS #11 software on your computer; you will be prompted to install the software separately.)

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Offer features to use securely encrypted single sign-on mechanisms
- Provide a smartcard reader

# Read and modify privacy settings

The extension could change privacy related settings controlling:

- Network behavior
- Whether passwords are stored in Thunderbird’s password manager
- The way Thunderbird interacts with websites

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Disable Thunderbird’s storage of passwords as part of an enhanced password manager
- Help protect your privacy by managing the information made available in real-time chat and video applications
- Offer additional tracking protection features

# Control Thunderbird’s proxy settings

The extension could direct some or all of Thunderbird’s web traffic to another computer (a proxy) on the internet.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Block access to certain websites or domains
- Provide access to certain websites and domains through proxy servers, for example, to access services which might otherwise be blocked by geography

# Access browser tabs

The extension could obtain the URL, title, and icon from any tab.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Order and group tabs
- Move tabs between windows
- Provide an alternative way of listing tabs

# Store unlimited amount of client-side data

The extension could store an unlimited amount of data using Thunderbird’s data storage features.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Store large files, such as images, locally in Thunderbird
- Offer an extensive local database of information

# Access browser activity during navigation

The extension could listen for the steps Thunderbird takes to navigate from a link to another page. The extension could then provide new features for the content on the page.

Extensions requesting this permission might:

- Detect when streamed videos are about to play and provide a download feature
- Look for and prevent ad pop-ups from opening

<h1 id=""w_selecting-a-folder-while-compact-is-in-progress"">Selecting a folder while compact is in progress</h1>
<p>Thunderbird can not read the index for the file while compacting is in progress, so when you select a folder, the mail in the folder will simply not be displayed until compact completes. When it does complete, the mail will reappear.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_software-interruption-to-the-process"">Software interruption to the process</h1>
<p>Sometimes after the compact, no messages display in the folder due to an interruption of the compact process. This causes an empty index file (.msf) to be created. Some possible causes of interruption are:
</p>
<ul><li> Controlling or not allowing access to the Thunderbird profile folder for backup scans
</li><li> Cloud syncing (which is not recommended)
</li><li> <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Antivirus_Related_Performance_Issues"">Antivirus software scans</a> (which is not recommended).

# Selecting a folder while compact is in progress

Thunderbird can not read the index for the file while compacting is in progress, so when you select a folder, the mail in the folder will simply not be displayed until compact completes. When it does complete, the mail will reappear.

# Software interruption to the process

Sometimes after the compact, no messages display in the folder due to an interruption of the compact process. This causes an empty index file (.msf) to be created. Some possible causes of interruption are:

- Controlling or not allowing access to the Thunderbird profile folder for backup scans
- Cloud syncing (which is not recommended)
- [Antivirus software scans](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Antivirus_Related_Performance_Issues) (which is not recommended).

Here's how you can cure the problem of an empty index file:

- Right click the folder
- Select Properties... from folder context menu
- Use the Repair folder button

This will force a new index to be built and should recover from this situation without data loss.

# Mail file has previously been deleted

Compact occurs and displays mail since the deletion, so the missing mail is all before a certain point in time. Whilst there have not been any known instances in the recent past, historically, antivirus products regularly scanned the mail storage file and if malware was found, deleted or quarantined the file. Due to Thunderbird using an index to fill the user interface, these types of deletions really only become obvious if an old mail is selected or a complete reindex occurs as in a compact process.

# Mail file corruption

If the underlying MBOX file is corrupt, then compact will write a new MBOX file that can at best be described as truncated. In this case, the mail list often retains the earliest entries, but later ones are lost from the point where the MBOX file became corrupt. Some of the more common causes are:

- Hard disk failure
- Memory failure
- Software or malware corrupting memory where the data to be written to file is stored

## Other symptoms of mail file corruption

One or more of these events may occur when the MBOX file is corrupt:

- Previously deleted messages reappearing
- Messages with a date of 1969
- Message bodies containing bits of other messages
- Messages in the message list not matching what is displayed when clicked

# Choose Thunderbird date and time formats defined by operating system or application locale

By default, Thunderbird will use date and time formats according to the regional settings of your operating system. If you have more than one language pack installed for Thunderbird, and if the regional settings of your operating system are different from your current Thunderbird user interface language, you can also choose the application locale for Date and Time Formatting:

≡ \> Preferences \> General \> Language & Appearance \> Date and Time Formatting \>  
(•) Application locale: German (Germany)  
(&nbsp;&nbsp;) Regional settings locale: English (United States)

**Note** : You need to **restart Thunderbird** for any changes to date and time formats to take effect!

This will reflect in the underlying Thunderbird preference:

**intl.regional\_prefs.use\_os\_locales = true** (default: Use _Regional Settings locale_ of operating system)

**intl.regional\_prefs.use\_os\_locales = false** (modified: Use current _Application locale_ of Thunderbird)

Thunderbird will then format date and time according to your regional choice, for example:

- English (United States): **01/02/2022, 12 PM**
- German (Germany): **02.01.2022, 12:00**

Whilst such regional formats might be well understood in their original regions, they can be ambiguous in international contexts, for example due to the inversion of day and month in North America, or (if you're used to that) the _absence_ of inversion the rest of the world, or the use of dots as separators. Similarly, the time 12 PM might leave many guessing if that's 12 noon or 12 midnight...

So if you are looking for an easy way to clarify your dates and times without resorting to Swedish regional settings, Thunderbird's date and time format override preferences will come in handy.

# Create date and time format override preferences using Thunderbird's Config Editor

Thunderbird's date and time format override preferences will allow you to apply date and time formats which are different and independent of those defined by the regional localizations available in your operating system or Thunderbird. **You need to create these preferences** and set them to your preferred format.

This feature is available starting from Thunderbird 91, soon available for download from [www.thunderbird.net](https://www.thunderbird.net) (until then, try it in [Thunderbird 91 beta](https://www.thunderbird.net/channel/)).

The following string preferences are supported by the platform:

| Preference | Example value | Output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.date\_short | yyyy-MM-dd | 2025-12-31 | Short date |
| intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.date\_medium | | | Medium date |
| intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.date\_long | | | Long date |
| intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.date\_full | | | Full date |
| intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.time\_short | HH:mm | 09:59 | Short time |
| intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.time\_medium | | | Medium time |
| intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.time\_long | | | Long time |
| intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.time\_full | | | Full time |

 **Note:**
- For the preference values, you need to use valid Unicode date field symbols like `yyyy-MM-dd`, as listed in the [Date Field Symbol Table](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).

The most useful preferences are **intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.date\_short** and **intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.time\_short**. For example, these preferences are used to construct the date/time stamps in message reader, in combination with **intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.connector\_short** described below.

You can use Thunderbird's inbuilt config editor to create these prefs:

- ≡ \> Preferences \> General \> Config Editor... button at the very bottom.
- Type the full name of the pref which you want to create into the search box, for example **intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.date\_short**. As the pref does not exist, it will show up in the results list as a new pref which you can create by first selecting (•) String and then using the the + button.
- It will then ask you for a value, and you can enter your preferred format pattern, like `yyyy-MM-dd` (you can always edit the value again later).

Then do the same by analogy for **intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.time\_short**.

Remember to **restart Thunderbird** for your custom date and time format preferences to take effect!

# Change the date/time connector (e.g. from comma to space)

You might also want to change that Thunderbird will typically connect date and time with a comma. First you need to create a preference called **intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.connector\_short**.

The connector preference value must have date and time placeholders in curly brackets.

- Date: **{1}**
- Time: **{0}**
- Any regular display text must be single-quoted to avoid parsing and truncated display, but some simple characters like space (&nbsp;) or comma (,) work without quoting.
- Apparently the format follows the [Date-Time Combination Examples](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Time_Combination_Examples).

Some examples:

**intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.connector\_short = `{1} {0}`** (single space between placeholders)  
Result for the short date and short time combination (as used in message display): **2021-06-24 21:00**

* * *

**intl.date\_time.pattern\_override.connector\_short = `{1}'T'{0}`**  
Result for the short date and short time combination: **2021-06-24T21:00**

You need to **restart** Thunderbird for your new connector to take effect!

<h2 id=""w_requirements-list"">Requirements List</h2>
<p>All of the items must be satisifed:
</p>
<ul><li> You must have a personal OpenPGP key or a personal S/MIME certificate, and you must configure Thunderbird to use it. How to do that is explained in a separate article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/thunderbird-help-setup-account-e2ee"">Setup your email account for using End-To-End Encryption</a>.
</li><li> If you had previously configured your own key or certificate, ensure it hasn't expired, it hasn't been revoked, and you haven't deleted it.
</li><li> Every email recipient that you added to the TO, CC or BCC fields must also own a personal OpenPGP key or personal S/MIME certificate, and they must have made the respective public key or certificate available. How you can obtain and use them is explained in the following sections in this article.
</li><li> When using group encryption utilizing the <a href=""/en-US/kb/openpgp-recipient-alias-configuration"">OpenPGP recipient alias feature</a>, the public keys for all recipients defined for an alias email address must be available.
</li><li> You must have keys or certificates of the same technology for all recipients including yourself, because OpenPGP and S/MIME are separate encryption technologies and cannot be mixed in a single email. Ensure you have selected the correct technology when composing an encrypted email.
</li></ul>
<p>If you need a more detailed explanation of the terms mentioned in this article, and to learn how email encryption technology works in general, you might want to read the article <a href=""/en-US/kb/introduction-to-e2e-encryption"">Introduction to End-to-end encryption in Thunderbird</a>.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_obtaining-openpgp-public-keys-of-correspondents"">Obtaining OpenPGP public keys of correspondents</h2>
<p>The following mechanisms can be used to obtain an OpenPGP public key:
</p>
<ul><li> Your correspondent sends an email to you, and they attach their public key to that email. When viewing such an email, if you click the OpenPGP button shown in the header area, Thunderbird will offer you to import the key.
</li><li> Your correspondent sends an email to you, which includes an Autocrypt header containing their public key. When viewing such an email, if you click the OpenPGP button shown in the header area, Thunderbird will offer you to import the key.
</li><li> Your correspondent has published their public key on a web server. Your correspondent may give you a link to their public key. Or you might use a web search and find the key yourself. In both cases you download the public key to a local file, and then use Thunderbird's OpenPGP Key Manager to import the file containing the public key.
</li><li> Your correspondent has published their public key on a server that uses the WKD protocol. When attempting to send an encrypted email, but you don't have a public key for a recipient's email address yet, Thunderbird may offer you to perform an online discovery, which is able to find public keys published using the WKD protocol.
</li><li> Your correspondent has published their public key on a keyserver that Thunderbird supports, such as the <a href=""http://keys.openpgp.org"">keys.openpgp.org</a> server. When attempting to send an encrypted email, but you don't have a public key for a recipient's email address yet, Thunderbird may offer you to perform an online discovery, which is able to find public keys published on that keyserver.
</li><li> Your correspondent has published their public key on a keyserver that Thunderbird isn't yet able to query automatically. If your correspondent tells you which keyserver contains their key, you might be able to use a web browser to visit that keyserver, search for their public key, download it to a file, and then import that file using Thunderbird's OpenPGP Key Manager.
</li></ul>
<p>If Thunderbird cannot find the key automatically, it is usually easiest to send a simple email (without encryption) to your correspondent, and ask them to send an email to you that contains their public key.
</p><p>With Thunderbird versions 78 and 91, if you received an email with a correspondent's key, it was necessary to interact with that email to import the key, either by using the right click menu on an attachment and asking to import it, or by clicking the OpenPGP button shown in the header area, which may report that the email contains a public key and may offer to import it.
</p><p>With Thunderbird versions 102 and newer, Thunderbird will automtically collect keys it sees in a cache for later use. When composing an email, and the correpondent's public key has not yet been imported, then Thunderbird may be able to automatically offer you to use public keys it has already collected.
</p><p>Note, it is not possible to review the cache of all keys that Thunderbird has automatically collected. If necessary, Thunderbird will offer you matching keys in the OpenPGP Key Assistant, which you can access from Thunderbird's email composer window.
</p><p>To review the list of already imported OpenPGP keys, you can use Thunderbird's OpenPGP Key Manager.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_obtaining-smime-certificates-of-correspondents"">Obtaining S/MIME certificates of correspondents</h2>
<p>The standard way of distributing a person's certificate is to send a digitally signed email. If you have received a signed email from your correspondent, click the email to view it. If Thunderbird considers the email's signature and the sender's certificate valid, it will automatically be imported and available when you attempt to encrypt an email to that correspondent using the S/MIME technology. If you don't have a signed email from your correspondent yet, you could ask them to send a digitally signed email to you.
</p><p>Note that certificates issued by CAs may have a short validity period. Certificates are no longer usable after the validity period has expired. In that case your correspondent will have to obtain a new certificate. Once that happened they will be able to send you a new digitally signed email with a valid certificate.
</p><p>Organizations that operate an LDAP server may configure their server to store S/MIME certificates. If an LDAP server is configured, Thunderbird may automatically query the LDAP server if it needs to obtain a S/MIME certificate.
</p><p>To review the list of S/MIME certificates that you already have, you can use Thunderbird's Certificate Manager.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_technical-validity"">Technical validity</h2>
<p>Thunderbird only uses keys and certificates that it considers technically valid.
</p><p>Thunderbird requires that an OpenPGP key contains at least one valid primary or subordinate key usable for creating digital signatures, and at least one key usable for encryption.
</p><p>Thunderbird may refuse to use OpenPGP keys that are corrupted, or that are based on cryptographic algorithms that Thunderbird considers to be unsafe.
</p><p>An OpenPGP public key has an inner structure, it may contain several subordinate keys, and it also contains properties, such as the validity period and the related user names and email addresses. Such properties may be added, removed or updated. To ensure that properties were really modified by the legitimate owner of the key, the properties are digitally signed using the owner's secret key. Each digital signature uses a signature algorithm. Thunderbird may ignore properties that are based on unsafe signature algorithms.
</p><p>If you have obtained someone's public key, and Thunderbird refuses to import or to use it, possible reasons are:
</p>
<ul><li> After importing it the key appears to lack certain properties.
</li><li> The key has an unexpected validity period.
</li><li> The key might contain unsafe properties that Thunderbird decided to reject or ignore.
</li></ul>
<h2 id=""w_matching-email-address"">Matching email address</h2>
<p>In order to use an OpenPGP public key or S/MIME certificate for sending an encrypted email to an email address, Thunderbird usually requires that the inner structure of the key or certificate lists the exactly matching email address. It allows Thunderbird to automatically decide if a public key or certificate can be used for an email address.
</p><p>In other words, if Alice wants to send encrypted email to bob@example.com, she needs an OpenPGP public key or S/MIME certificate that claims to be for that email address. A key or certificate claiming to be for bobby@example.com wouldn't be used by Thunderbird.
</p><p>If Alice really wanted to use the public key or certificate listing bobby@example.com for sending email to bob@example.com, then Alice would have to have additional knowledge about Bob's email addresses, which aren't obvious. Bob would have to ask Alice to use that key despite the email address mismatch. Alice would have to ask Thunderbird to use the public key or certificate despite the mismatch.
</p><p>This is considered an advanced scenario, which some users might be required to use, but which most users don't need. Thunderbird currently doesn't offer an interactive solution for this.
</p><p>However, because some expert users have requested support for using mismatching OpenPGP public keys, Thunderbird is offering an advanced configuration mechanism, which is documented in the article <a href=""/en-US/kb/thunderbird-help-openpgp-alias"">Thunderbird and OpenPGP Alias Keys</a>.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_accepting"">Accepting</h2>
<p>If you have obtained an OpenPGP public key, and the key claims to be in the name of your correspondent, and contains your correspondent's email address, there is still a risk that it is not <em>the right key</em>. The risk is described in detail in the article <a href=""/en-US/kb/thunderbird-help-openpgp-counterfeit-key"">OpenPGP keys might be authentic or counterfeit</a>.
</p><p>Because of this risk, Thunderbird doesn't use OpenPGP public keys automatically. Rather, for each public key you'd like to use, you are required to confirm that the key is acceptable for you, as described in the above article.
</p><p>In other words, if Alice has obtained an OpenPGP public key that lists the email address bob@example.com, and Alice attempts to send an encrypted email to bob@example.com, Thunderbird might complain that there's no <em>accepted</em> key for Bob yet. Alice must follow the guidance offered on screen to review the key or keys that are available for bob@example.com, she should review it, she should ideally verify it, and she needs to mark the key as accepted.
</p><p>For S/MIME, technically valid certificates that are signed by a CA that has been included in Thunderbird according based on the <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/"">Mozilla Root Store Policy</a> will automatically be accepted by Thunderbird for sending encrypted email to the address listed in the certificate.

## Requirements List

All of the items must be satisifed:

- You must have a personal OpenPGP key or a personal S/MIME certificate, and you must configure Thunderbird to use it. How to do that is explained in a separate article: [Setup your email account for using End-To-End Encryption](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-help-setup-account-e2ee"").
- If you had previously configured your own key or certificate, ensure it hasn't expired, it hasn't been revoked, and you haven't deleted it.
- Every email recipient that you added to the TO, CC or BCC fields must also own a personal OpenPGP key or personal S/MIME certificate, and they must have made the respective public key or certificate available. How you can obtain and use them is explained in the following sections in this article.
- When using group encryption utilizing the [OpenPGP recipient alias feature](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/openpgp-recipient-alias-configuration""), the public keys for all recipients defined for an alias email address must be available.
- You must have keys or certificates of the same technology for all recipients including yourself, because OpenPGP and S/MIME are separate encryption technologies and cannot be mixed in a single email. Ensure you have selected the correct technology when composing an encrypted email.

If you need a more detailed explanation of the terms mentioned in this article, and to learn how email encryption technology works in general, you might want to read the article [Introduction to End-to-end encryption in Thunderbird](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/introduction-to-e2e-encryption"").

## Obtaining OpenPGP public keys of correspondents

The following mechanisms can be used to obtain an OpenPGP public key:

- Your correspondent sends an email to you, and they attach their public key to that email. When viewing such an email, if you click the OpenPGP button shown in the header area, Thunderbird will offer you to import the key.
- Your correspondent sends an email to you, which includes an Autocrypt header containing their public key. When viewing such an email, if you click the OpenPGP button shown in the header area, Thunderbird will offer you to import the key.
- Your correspondent has published their public key on a web server. Your correspondent may give you a link to their public key. Or you might use a web search and find the key yourself. In both cases you download the public key to a local file, and then use Thunderbird's OpenPGP Key Manager to import the file containing the public key.
- Your correspondent has published their public key on a server that uses the WKD protocol. When attempting to send an encrypted email, but you don't have a public key for a recipient's email address yet, Thunderbird may offer you to perform an online discovery, which is able to find public keys published using the WKD protocol.
- Your correspondent has published their public key on a keyserver that Thunderbird supports, such as the [keys.openpgp.org](http://keys.openpgp.org) server. When attempting to send an encrypted email, but you don't have a public key for a recipient's email address yet, Thunderbird may offer you to perform an online discovery, which is able to find public keys published on that keyserver.
- Your correspondent has published their public key on a keyserver that Thunderbird isn't yet able to query automatically. If your correspondent tells you which keyserver contains their key, you might be able to use a web browser to visit that keyserver, search for their public key, download it to a file, and then import that file using Thunderbird's OpenPGP Key Manager.

If Thunderbird cannot find the key automatically, it is usually easiest to send a simple email (without encryption) to your correspondent, and ask them to send an email to you that contains their public key.

With Thunderbird versions 78 and 91, if you received an email with a correspondent's key, it was necessary to interact with that email to import the key, either by using the right click menu on an attachment and asking to import it, or by clicking the OpenPGP button shown in the header area, which may report that the email contains a public key and may offer to import it.

With Thunderbird versions 102 and newer, Thunderbird will automtically collect keys it sees in a cache for later use. When composing an email, and the correpondent's public key has not yet been imported, then Thunderbird may be able to automatically offer you to use public keys it has already collected.

Note, it is not possible to review the cache of all keys that Thunderbird has automatically collected. If necessary, Thunderbird will offer you matching keys in the OpenPGP Key Assistant, which you can access from Thunderbird's email composer window.

To review the list of already imported OpenPGP keys, you can use Thunderbird's OpenPGP Key Manager.

## Obtaining S/MIME certificates of correspondents

The standard way of distributing a person's certificate is to send a digitally signed email. If you have received a signed email from your correspondent, click the email to view it. If Thunderbird considers the email's signature and the sender's certificate valid, it will automatically be imported and available when you attempt to encrypt an email to that correspondent using the S/MIME technology. If you don't have a signed email from your correspondent yet, you could ask them to send a digitally signed email to you.

Note that certificates issued by CAs may have a short validity period. Certificates are no longer usable after the validity period has expired. In that case your correspondent will have to obtain a new certificate. Once that happened they will be able to send you a new digitally signed email with a valid certificate.

Organizations that operate an LDAP server may configure their server to store S/MIME certificates. If an LDAP server is configured, Thunderbird may automatically query the LDAP server if it needs to obtain a S/MIME certificate.

To review the list of S/MIME certificates that you already have, you can use Thunderbird's Certificate Manager.

## Technical validity

Thunderbird only uses keys and certificates that it considers technically valid.

Thunderbird requires that an OpenPGP key contains at least one valid primary or subordinate key usable for creating digital signatures, and at least one key usable for encryption.

Thunderbird may refuse to use OpenPGP keys that are corrupted, or that are based on cryptographic algorithms that Thunderbird considers to be unsafe.

An OpenPGP public key has an inner structure, it may contain several subordinate keys, and it also contains properties, such as the validity period and the related user names and email addresses. Such properties may be added, removed or updated. To ensure that properties were really modified by the legitimate owner of the key, the properties are digitally signed using the owner's secret key. Each digital signature uses a signature algorithm. Thunderbird may ignore properties that are based on unsafe signature algorithms.

If you have obtained someone's public key, and Thunderbird refuses to import or to use it, possible reasons are:

- After importing it the key appears to lack certain properties.
- The key has an unexpected validity period.
- The key might contain unsafe properties that Thunderbird decided to reject or ignore.

## Matching email address

In order to use an OpenPGP public key or S/MIME certificate for sending an encrypted email to an email address, Thunderbird usually requires that the inner structure of the key or certificate lists the exactly matching email address. It allows Thunderbird to automatically decide if a public key or certificate can be used for an email address.

In other words, if Alice wants to send encrypted email to bob@example.com, she needs an OpenPGP public key or S/MIME certificate that claims to be for that email address. A key or certificate claiming to be for bobby@example.com wouldn't be used by Thunderbird.

If Alice really wanted to use the public key or certificate listing bobby@example.com for sending email to bob@example.com, then Alice would have to have additional knowledge about Bob's email addresses, which aren't obvious. Bob would have to ask Alice to use that key despite the email address mismatch. Alice would have to ask Thunderbird to use the public key or certificate despite the mismatch.

This is considered an advanced scenario, which some users might be required to use, but which most users don't need. Thunderbird currently doesn't offer an interactive solution for this.

However, because some expert users have requested support for using mismatching OpenPGP public keys, Thunderbird is offering an advanced configuration mechanism, which is documented in the article [Thunderbird and OpenPGP Alias Keys](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-help-openpgp-alias"").

## Accepting

If you have obtained an OpenPGP public key, and the key claims to be in the name of your correspondent, and contains your correspondent's email address, there is still a risk that it is not _the right key_. The risk is described in detail in the article [OpenPGP keys might be authentic or counterfeit](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-help-openpgp-counterfeit-key"").

Because of this risk, Thunderbird doesn't use OpenPGP public keys automatically. Rather, for each public key you'd like to use, you are required to confirm that the key is acceptable for you, as described in the above article.

In other words, if Alice has obtained an OpenPGP public key that lists the email address bob@example.com, and Alice attempts to send an encrypted email to bob@example.com, Thunderbird might complain that there's no _accepted_ key for Bob yet. Alice must follow the guidance offered on screen to review the key or keys that are available for bob@example.com, she should review it, she should ideally verify it, and she needs to mark the key as accepted.

For S/MIME, technically valid certificates that are signed by a CA that has been included in Thunderbird according based on the [Mozilla Root Store Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/) will automatically be accepted by Thunderbird for sending encrypted email to the address listed in the certificate.

<p>If you want to exchange encrypted messages with correspondents that are already set up to use OpenPGP, then you need an OpenPGP personal key for yourself. Thunderbird defines this as a key pair, consisting of secret and public keys, together with a label that contains your own email address.
</p><p>If you have never created an OpenPGP key in Thunderbird, but you have previously used other OpenPGP software, you might already be in possession of a secret key. Use a backup/export feature of your other software to save the secret key to a file, and, if that worked, then try to import the result file into Thunderbird.
</p>
<div class=""note""><strong>Note:</strong> Thunderbird will remove the protection of secret keys when importing them into Thunderbird. To ensure that your secret keys are still stored securely on your computer, it is best to set up a <a href=""/en-US/kb/protect-your-thunderbird-passwords-primary-password"">Primary Password</a> in Thunderbird settings, which will then be automatically used to protect your OpenPGP secret keys, too.</div>
<p>If you have previously used Thunderbird 68 (or older versions) with the Enigmail add-on, you might already have secret keys, because several versions of Enigmail automatically created secret keys without asking you. They might still be stored on your computer. If you would like to reuse them with the latest Thunderbird version, you could try to use the GnuPG software to retrieve them. (See the corresponding entry in the document <a href=""/en-US/kb/openpgp-thunderbird-howto-and-faq"">OpenPGP in Thunderbird - HOWTO and FAQ</a>.)
</p><p>If you have never used other software to create OpenPGP keys, or if you prefer not to reuse them, then Thunderbird allows you to create this kind of key for yourself inside Account Settings, in the <span class=""menu"">End-To-End Encryption</span> tab.
</p><p>Click the button to <span class=""button"">Add a key…</span>, then either select import or create, depending on your needs.

</p>
<ul><li> the key is not expired
</li><li> the key is not revoked
</li><li> the key is valid for both digital signing and encryption
</li><li> the key contains a user ID with the email address of the account or identity that you are configuring inside Account Settings

<p>Once you select it, you have completed your own setup for OpenPGP email security.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_your-own-smime-configuration"">Your own S/MIME configuration</h2>
<p>If you want to exchange encrypted messages with correspondents that are already set up to use S/MIME, then you need a personal email certificate key for yourself.
</p><p>The S/MIME email encryption technology depends on the service of trusted third parties, so called Certificate Authorities (CA), from whom you must obtain a personal certificate for yourself, and install and configure it in Thunderbird.
</p><p>Usually it isn't practical to create a certificate by yourself, because your email correspondents will usually not accept such self-signed certificates.
</p><p>The preparation steps for obtaining a personal certificate from a CA usually are:
</p>
<ol><li> you create raw cryptographic keys, a pair of a secret and a public key
</li><li> you send your public key to a CA that is supported by Thunderbird
</li><li> the CA will sign your public key on their systems and adding some more data to it to create your certificate
</li><li> the CA sends the certificate back to you
</li><li> you combine the received certificate with the secret key that you had previously created, this turns the certificate into your personal certificate
</li><li> you import your personal certificate using Thunderbird's Certificate Manager
</li><li> you open Thunderbird account settings, End-To-End Encryption, and you select the certificate that you wish to use with that email account (only personal certificates considered valid by Thunderbird will be offered for selection). Select the certificate for both encryption and digital signing.
</li></ol>
<p>Recent versions of Thunderbird cannot assist you in creating your raw key pair for S/MIME. You need to use external software.
Some CAs offer you the convenience to automatically create a key pair for you. This isn't ideal, because the secret key used for your personal certificate may be created on the computers operated by the CA. There is the risk that someone obtains and keeps a copy of the secret key, which could enable them to decrypt the encrypted email messages that are sent to you.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_test-your-own-setup"">Test your own Setup</h2>
<p>Once you have completed your own setup, you should test it. Try to send an encrypted and digitally signed email to yourself. To do that, compose a new message. If you have multiple accounts or identities, ensure that the From address at the top of the composer window shows an identity for which you have already completed the End-To-End Encryption setup.
</p><p>Then enter the same email address into the To address field. Also add a test subject and test message contents. Then enable encryption. (In Thunderbird version 102, this can be done easily with the <span class=""button"">Encrypt</span> toolbar button. In earlier versions, click the arrow shown after the <span class=""button"">Security</span> toolbar button, and select <span class=""button"">Require encryption</span>.) Then send the message. Then go back to your inbox, get new messages, and you should receive the message you have just sent. It should be reported as having been encrypted, refer to the appropriate S/MIME or OpenPGP labels in the message header area, which can be clicked to show detail information.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_distributing-your-own-public-key-or-certificate"">Distributing your own public key or certificate</h2>
<p>If you want to enable others to send encrypted email to you, it might be useful to not wait until they ask you to send your public key to them.
</p><p>You could decide to be proactive, and ensure that other people will be able to obtain your public key or certificate when they decide to send you encrypted email. A simple way to do so is by sending a digitally signed email.
</p><p>If you send a digitally signed email using the <strong>OpenPGP</strong> technology, Thunderbird will usually include a copy of your public key as a small attachment, which is automatically added, because the public key is required to verify that a digital signature is technically valid.
</p><p>If you send a digitally signed email using the <strong>S/MIME</strong> technology, your certificate is always included.
</p><p>You can decide that you will always digitally sign the emails you send, you can find the respective setting in Account Settings. (Please be aware, if you digitally sign an email, you will probably no longer be able to plausibly deny that you were the sender of an email you have sent.)
</p><p>Another way to distribute an OpenPGP public key is to use a keyserver. The keyserver available at <a href=""https://keys.openpgp.org/"">https://keys.openpgp.org/</a> (operated by members of the OpenPGP developer community) is a good choice for publishing your public key. Thunderbird versions 78, 91 and 102 are capable of querying this keyserver when performing an online discovery for missing public keys.
</p><p>To publish your key, you must export your public key to a file, for example by using the menu next to your configured personal key in Thunderbird account settings, or by using Thunderbird's OpenPGP Key Manager. Be careful and use the correct command. For obtaining a copy of your key that is safe for sharing with others, always use a command that talks about a public key operation. <strong>Never share your personal, secret key!</strong>
</p><p>Once you have a file that contains your public key, you could also distribute your key using any other mechanism that works for sharing files, such as hosting the file on your own website.

Use a backup/export feature of your other software to save the secret key to a file, and, if that worked, then try to import the result file into Thunderbird.

**Note:** Thunderbird will remove the protection of secret keys when importing them into Thunderbird. To ensure that your secret keys are still stored securely on your computer, it is best to set up a [Primary Password](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/protect-your-thunderbird-passwords-primary-password"") in Thunderbird settings, which will then be automatically used to protect your OpenPGP secret keys, too.

If you have previously used Thunderbird 68 (or older versions) with the Enigmail add-on, you might already have secret keys, because several versions of Enigmail automatically created secret keys without asking you. They might still be stored on your computer. If you would like to reuse them with the latest Thunderbird version, you could try to use the GnuPG software to retrieve them. (See the corresponding entry in the document [OpenPGP in Thunderbird - HOWTO and FAQ](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/openpgp-thunderbird-howto-and-faq"").)

If you have never used other software to create OpenPGP keys, or if you prefer not to reuse them, then Thunderbird allows you to create this kind of key for yourself inside Account Settings, in the End-To-End Encryption tab.

Click the button to Add a key…, then either select import or create, depending on your needs.

After you import a key, then Thunderbird should offer you to select it as the personal key for that account or identity, if it passed the following requirements during import:

- the key is not expired
- the key is not revoked
- the key is valid for both digital signing and encryption
- the key contains a user ID with the email address of the account or identity that you are configuring inside Account Settings

Once you select it, you have completed your own setup for OpenPGP email security.

## Your own S/MIME configuration

If you want to exchange encrypted messages with correspondents that are already set up to use S/MIME, then you need a personal email certificate key for yourself.

The S/MIME email encryption technology depends on the service of trusted third parties, so called Certificate Authorities (CA), from whom you must obtain a personal certificate for yourself, and install and configure it in Thunderbird.

Usually it isn't practical to create a certificate by yourself, because your email correspondents will usually not accept such self-signed certificates.

The preparation steps for obtaining a personal certificate from a CA usually are:

1. you create raw cryptographic keys, a pair of a secret and a public key
2. you send your public key to a CA that is supported by Thunderbird
3. the CA will sign your public key on their systems and adding some more data to it to create your certificate
4. the CA sends the certificate back to you
5. you combine the received certificate with the secret key that you had previously created, this turns the certificate into your personal certificate
6. you import your personal certificate using Thunderbird's Certificate Manager
7. you open Thunderbird account settings, End-To-End Encryption, and you select the certificate that you wish to use with that email account (only personal certificates considered valid by Thunderbird will be offered for selection). Select the certificate for both encryption and digital signing.

Recent versions of Thunderbird cannot assist you in creating your raw key pair for S/MIME. You need to use external software. Some CAs offer you the convenience to automatically create a key pair for you. This isn't ideal, because the secret key used for your personal certificate may be created on the computers operated by the CA. There is the risk that someone obtains and keeps a copy of the secret key, which could enable them to decrypt the encrypted email messages that are sent to you.

## Test your own Setup

Once you have completed your own setup, you should test it. Try to send an encrypted and digitally signed email to yourself. To do that, compose a new message. If you have multiple accounts or identities, ensure that the From address at the top of the composer window shows an identity for which you have already completed the End-To-End Encryption setup.

Then enter the same email address into the To address field. Also add a test subject and test message contents. Then enable encryption. (In Thunderbird version 102, this can be done easily with the Encrypt toolbar button. In earlier versions, click the arrow shown after the Security toolbar button, and select Require encryption.) Then send the message. Then go back to your inbox, get new messages, and you should receive the message you have just sent. It should be reported as having been encrypted, refer to the appropriate S/MIME or OpenPGP labels in the message header area, which can be clicked to show detail information.

## Distributing your own public key or certificate

If you want to enable others to send encrypted email to you, it might be useful to not wait until they ask you to send your public key to them.

You could decide to be proactive, and ensure that other people will be able to obtain your public key or certificate when they decide to send you encrypted email. A simple way to do so is by sending a digitally signed email.

If you send a digitally signed email using the **OpenPGP** technology, Thunderbird will usually include a copy of your public key as a small attachment, which is automatically added, because the public key is required to verify that a digital signature is technically valid.

If you send a digitally signed email using the **S/MIME** technology, your certificate is always included.

You can decide that you will always digitally sign the emails you send, you can find the respective setting in Account Settings. (Please be aware, if you digitally sign an email, you will probably no longer be able to plausibly deny that you were the sender of an email you have sent.)

Another way to distribute an OpenPGP public key is to use a keyserver. The keyserver available at [https://keys.openpgp.org/](https://keys.openpgp.org/) (operated by members of the OpenPGP developer community) is a good choice for publishing your public key. Thunderbird versions 78, 91 and 102 are capable of querying this keyserver when performing an online discovery for missing public keys.

To publish your key, you must export your public key to a file, for example by using the menu next to your configured personal key in Thunderbird account settings, or by using Thunderbird's OpenPGP Key Manager. Be careful and use the correct command. For obtaining a copy of your key that is safe for sharing with others, always use a command that talks about a public key operation. **Never share your personal, secret key!**

Once you have a file that contains your public key, you could also distribute your key using any other mechanism that works for sharing files, such as hosting the file on your own website.

# Before we begin

During a version upgrade, some versions of Thunderbird perform data and other conversions (for example address book data) to enable new capabilities. If you skip an important version, then Thunderbird may not work, you may have missing or incorrect data, or other complications may occur. To avoid this, closely follow these directions.

During this process, third-party add-ons may require an update, or may no longer work on newer versions of Thunderbird.

Check which version of Thunderbird you currently have installed using [Find what version of Thunderbird you are using](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-what-version-thunderbird-you-are-using"").

**Important:** Before upgrading, always back up your profile. Please see [Profiles - Where Thunderbird stores your messages and other user data](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"") for more information. Also ensure your computer is compatible with the [latest version of Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/system-requirements/).

# Automatic upgrade with 60.9.1 or newer

You need to be on version 60.9.1 or newer to be able to automatically upgrade to the current version of Thunderbird.

## Automatically upgrade to the current version

You can automatically upgrade in multiple steps from the version you start with (60.9.1 or newer) to the current version. The number of steps varies depending on where you start. If you start at 60.9.1, you will go from 60.9.1 to 68.12.1 to 78.14 to 91.13 to 102.15.1 to the current version (TB 115 or newer).

Repeat the following steps until you are at the current version of Thunderbird:

- Click ≡ \> Help \> About Thunderbird (About Mozilla Thunderbird in TB60)
- Click Restart Thunderbird ({Restart to update Thunderbird in TB60)
- Wait for the newly upgraded Thunderbird to open

And that is it, you have now upgraded to the latest version of Thunderbird! The interface may have changed from your previous version. We recommend familiarizing yourself with any interface changes.

# If you are on a version older than 60

<p>Automatic upgrades will not work if you are on a version older than 60. The steps below will get you to version 60.

## Changes to Authentication

Microsoft has instituted the following changes:

- [Deprecated basic authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-basic-authentication-exchange-online) (username/password), and is instead now requiring OAuth authentication.
- In some cases, SMTP authentication has been completely disabled. For new accounts, SMTP always starts disabled. In addition, there are some restrictions on SMTP that are not currently understood.

Microsoft have also changed the way they classify certain clients, and Thunderbird’s previous OAuth setup does not properly qualify as a desktop client. As a result, we have been forced to make configuration changes to Thunderbird, which may have side effects for users.

## Changes or Problems You May Encounter

### A screen that indicates IT administrator approval is required for the app

- You must ask your administrator to authorize Thunderbird – approval must be done, but only once.
- Per Microsoft documentation, administrators should visit **`https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/adminconsent?client_id=9e5f94bc-e8a4-4e73-b8be-63364c29d753`** and grant the following permissions in order to authorize _Mozilla Thunderbird_: **IMAP.AccessAsUser.All** , **POP.AccessAsUser.Al** , **SMTP.Send** and **offline\_access**

### An account worked on Thunderbird 102.6.1, but does not work on 102.7.1 or later

- Please try signing in with a new Thunderbird profile (see [Profile Manager - Create and remove Thunderbird profiles](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles"") for instructions on how to create a new profile).
- If a new Thunderbird profile works, then for most people it is best to continue using the new profile.<dl><dt>
<div class=""note""> <strong>More technical folks who want to keep other changes made in the config editor</strong>: Use the Thunderbird profile manager to switch back to the old Thunderbird profile and use the <a href='\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/config-editor""'>Config Editor</a> to filter for <strong>oauth2</strong>, find the appropriate server(s), and delete the entries for <strong>oauth2.issuer</strong> and <strong>auth2.scope</strong>.</div>
</dt></dl>
- Otherwise, [ask for support](https://support.mozilla.org/questions/new/thunderbird/form).

### IMAP/POP3 work, but SMTP does not work

- If you have a Microsoft 365 business account, ensure that SMTP authentication is enabled or ask your IT administrator to check and turn it on if disabled. Microsoft has some instructions in their article: [Enable or disable authenticated client SMTP submission (SMTP AUTH) in Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/authenticated-client-smtp-submission).
- If you have a Microsoft 365/Hotmail/etc. **personal** account, use basic authentication ([Microsoft’s guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-for-outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040) on how to change this).

### Calendar does not work

- Thunderbird does not support Exchange calendars. If you are using an add-on or other software to enable calendar, then you will need to seek support from the author of that add-on or software.

## Where to Get Help

- If you are a user within a business or academic institution that provides Microsoft accounts, you should seek assistance within your organization.
- If you have a personal account through one of Microsoft's hosted services, [ask for support](https://support.mozilla.org/questions/new/thunderbird/form).

Add your Matrix account with SSO as follows:≡ \> New Account \> Chat \> select Matrix \> Next

- For ""Username"", enter your username e.g. For ""Server"", enter the primary domain of your SSO account. For example, if your account is: ""@awesomeaccount:[matrix.org](http://matrix.org)"", enter awesomeaccount in the ""Username"" field and [matrix.org](http://matrix.org) in the ""Server"" field. Click Next.
- Since you are using an SSO account, there is no need to enter a password i.e. please leave the ""Password"" field empty. Click Next.
- For most people, you can simply click Next; there is no need to change the ""Advanced options"".
- On the ""Summary"" page, ensure the checkbox for ""Connect this account now"" is ticked and click Finish.
- Thunderbird will now open a separate page to ask for the credentials of your SSO account, which you should complete as usual.

<p>In order to provide a better, more easily configurable user experience, Thunderbird 115 has taken must stronger control of UI sizing. As a result, we see rare unexpected reports of zoom not working, or too large or too small displays or fonts which require your adjustment or investigation. This can be caused by:
</p>
<ul><li> Something changed an unsupported preference called <em>layout.css.devPixelsPerPx</em>
</li><li> Something changed an unsupported preference called <em>mail.uifontsize</em>
</li><li> CSS overrides in <em>userChrome.css</em> (which are <a href=""/en-US/kb/userchromecss-js-usercontent-unsupported"">unsupported</a>) 
</li><li> Other reasons, which require investigation
</li></ul>
<p>To reset <em>layout.css.devPixelsPerPx</em> directly to the supported default value:
</p>
<ul><li> Click <span class=""menu"">≡</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Settings</span> &gt; <span class=""button"">General</span>.
</li><li> Scroll down to the bottom and click <span class=""button"">Config Editor…</span>.

<h3 id=""w_step-2-turn-on-cards-view"">Step 2: Turn on Cards View</h3>
<p>“Cards” view is a new way of displaying your message list. It is simpler and more compact, to help reduce cognitive burden when you view the list;

</li></ul>
<p>Cards View is still in active development. More features such as a message preview line and sender avatars will be added in the future. 
</p>
<div class=""note"">
<p><strong>TIP #1:</strong> Are you having trouble finding that menu? The area of Thunderbird where you activate Cards View is called the ""Message List Header"". Some people choose to hide this section to reclaim a bit of vertical space. It is easy to get it back:  
</p>
<ul><li> Click <span class=""menu"">≡</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">View</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Layout</span> &gt; tick i.e. ensure <span class=""menu"">Message List Header</span> is checked ✓

<p><strong>TIP #2:</strong> Cards View is also available when using Classic or Wide layouts. 
</p>
</div>
<h3 id=""w_step-3-turn-on-tags-folder-mode"">Step 3: Turn on “Tags” Folder Mode</h3>
<p>There is a new <span class=""menu"">Folder pane options</span> menu also known as a “meatball” or “three horizontal dots” menu, <span class=""menu"">⋯</span>, to the <strong>right</strong> of <span class=""button"">+ New Message</span>. This menu has options to show the Total message count, Folder Size and hide the <em>Get Messages</em> and <em>New Message</em> icons as well as hide the Local Folders and the Folder Pane Header. It also has a <span class=""menu"">Folder Modes</span> sub menu which has options for display folders in the Folder Pane as well a new option to show Tags in the Folder Pane.
</p><p>If Tags are an important part of your workflow, here's how to make it easier to access them (<a href=""https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/08/TB-115-Activate-Tags-Folder-Mode.gif"">animated GIF</a>):
</p>
<ul><li> Click <span class=""menu"">⋯</span> to the <strong>right</strong> of <span class=""button"">+ New Message</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Folder Modes</span> &gt; tick i.e. ensure <span class=""menu"">Tags</span> is checked ""✓"".

</div>
<h3 id=""w_step-4-customize-the-message-header"">Step 4: Customize The Message Header</h3>
<p>The Message Header is the section at the top of the Message Pane where the email is displayed, showing information such as sender’s name, contact photo (which pulls from the Address Book), subject, any associated tags, and more. Configure the Message Header Settings to suit your preferences as follows (<a href=""https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/08/TB-115-Customize-Message-Header.gif"">animated GIF</a>):
</p>
<ul><li> In the Message Pane, click <span class=""button"">More ⌄</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Customize...</span> make it yours &gt; <span class=""button"">Done</span> Before clicking <span class=""button"">Done</span>, make it yours by deciding if you want to display a profile picture, show the sender's profile picture, sender's full address, show all headers, hide labels etc.

<h2 id=""w_why-doesnt-thunderbird-follow-the-operating-system-accent-colors-especially-on-linux"">Why doesn’t Thunderbird follow the operating system accent colors, especially on Linux?</h2>
<p>The Thunderbird user interface (UI) is extremely large and complicated, with many moving pieces and UI elements that the user can select, move, highlight, etc.
</p><p>By default, we ship Thunderbird with its own brand identity in order to guarantee AAA color contrast and readability between foreground and background elements.
</p><p>Areas like the Message List Pane, or the Folder Pane, contain many elements and icons with specific colors that need to change and adapt depending on the state of the element.
</p><p>A selected element will display a different background color. If the selected element is not currently focused, it will display a different color. If the element is only focused but not selected, it will display yet another color.
</p><p>These examples are just a fraction of the many variations we need to handle in every single UI element.
</p><p>Allowing every Operating System, especially Linux Desktop Environments, to fully affect the Thunderbird colors continually created issues and unexpected consequences.
</p><p>The amount of bug reports of users unable to properly see the reply icon with their KDE Arch Theme with Dracula accent colors is something we constantly struggled with to give a humorous but relevant example.
</p><p>Even the default Ubuntu color scheme, with its orange accent color, created constant unexpected consequences.
</p><p>We do not have the resources to support each variation or edge case.
</p><p>Our primary focus is to guarantee that Thunderbird is always readable and usable in every configuration. Therefore, enforcing our own brand identity and keeping it consistent across operating systems allowed us to remove these unexpected breakages and reduce the number of bug reports about accessibility and visibility.
</p>
<h3 id=""w_why-does-firefox-follow-the-os-colors"">Why does Firefox follow the OS colors?</h3>
<p>Because the Firefox UI is mostly just a toolbar and a settings page with monochromatic line icons. It is a much simpler and self contained UI that does not need to worry about color contrast and readability, and following system colors is easy to support.
</p>
<h3 id=""w_we-recommend-add-ons-and-themes-to-customize-your-colors"">We recommend Add-ons and Themes to customize your colors</h3>
<p>We rebuilt the UI in order to rely entirely on CSS variables.
</p><p>We did this so add-on developers can create their own themes and drastically change the look and feel of Thunderbird by tweaking a few CSS variables. This is still a work in progress and improving constantly, but we are already seeing heavily customized themes to make Thunderbird look like a native GTK application, for example.
</p>
<h2 id=""w_why-are-my-thunderbird-customizations-broken-in-115"">Why are my Thunderbird customizations broken in 115?</h2>
<p>If your customization required changes to userChrome.css, userContent.css, or other related files, then these <a href=""/en-US/kb/userchromecss-js-usercontent-unsupported"">userChrome* customizations are still unsupported in 115</a> (they were also unsupported in 102 and all previous releases). There may be <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/questions/thunderbird?tagged=unsupporteduserchromecss&amp;show=all"">solutions in the forums</a> but please remember these are unofficial; unsupported solutions and could break at any time.

## Why are Thunderbird 115’s fonts so large? So small?

For most people, this issue can be solved using the Thunderbird Application menu, ≡ as follows&nbsp;:

- Change the density to suit your taste: Click ≡ \> Density. Then click ![tb115-relaxed-density](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) (for ""Relaxed"") to increase the size of UI elements in Thunderbird or click ![tb115-compact-density](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) (for ""Compact"") to decrease the size.
- Change the font size to suit your needs: Click ≡ \> Font Size. Click + to increase the size of the fonts or click - to decrease the size of the fonts.

## Why are the fonts still too large (or too small) after I changed the density and font size?

In order to provide a better, more easily configurable user experience, Thunderbird 115 has taken must stronger control of UI sizing. As a result, we see rare unexpected reports of zoom not working, or too large or too small displays or fonts which require your adjustment or investigation. This can be caused by:

- Something changed an unsupported preference called _layout.css.devPixelsPerPx_
- Something changed an unsupported preference called _mail.uifontsize_
- CSS overrides in _userChrome.css_ (which are [unsupported](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/userchromecss-js-usercontent-unsupported"")) 
- Other reasons, which require investigation

To reset _layout.css.devPixelsPerPx_ directly to the supported default value:

- Click ≡ \> Settings \> General.
- Scroll down to the bottom and click Config Editor….
- Enter _layout.css.devPixelsPerPx_ and if it has been changed you will see a reset button which will look like a counter clockwise arrow button, ![tb115-undo-16x16](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif). Click ![tb115-undo-16x16](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) to reset the value immediately.

To reset _mail.uifontsize_ directly to the supported default value:

- Click ≡ \> Settings \> General.
- Scroll down to the bottom and click Config Editor….
- Enter _mail.uifontsize_ and if it has been changed you will see a reset button which will look like a counter clockwise arrow button, ![tb115-undo-16x16](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif). Click ![tb115-undo-16x16](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) to reset the value immediately.

Please [consider turning off all userChrome customizations](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/userchromecss-js-usercontent-unsupported"").

## How do I get the Thunderbird 115 “Supernova” Look?

Thunderbird 115 “Supernova” ships with brand new layout options to give you a more beautiful and more productive email experience. But those new options are not on by default for many. Here's how to turn on these new options (inspired by the blog post: [Make Thunderbird Yours: How To Get The Thunderbird 115 “Supernova” Look](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/08/make-thunderbird-yours-how-to-get-the-thunderbird-115-supernova-look/)).

### Step 1: Turn on Vertical View

Rearrange the Folder pane, Message List pane, and Message pane to be displayed side-by-side (also known as ""Vertical View"") as follows ([animated GIF](https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/08/TB-115-Switch-to-Vertical-Layout.gif)):

- Click: The Application Menu i.e. ≡ \> View \> Layout \> tick i.e. ensure Vertical View is checked ""✓"".<dl><dt>
<img alt=""tb115-vertical-ticked"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2023-09-07-10-32-19-862529.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>

### Step 2: Turn on Cards View

“Cards” view is a new way of displaying your message list. It is simpler and more compact, to help reduce cognitive burden when you view the list;

- Click ![tb115-display-options-icon-offical-from-micah](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif) (which is the new _Message list display options_ icon and is on the right of the _Quick Filter_ icon) \> Cards View ([animated GIF](https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/08/TB-115-Switch-to-Cards-View.gif)). See also: [Getting Started with the Thunderbird main window (Supernova and newer)](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/getting-started-thunderbird-main-window-supernova#w_vertical-view-layout-with-card-view"").<dl><dt>
<img alt=""tb115-howto-turn-on-card-view"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2023-09-07-15-50-03-d371e4.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>

Cards View is still in active development. More features such as a message preview line and sender avatars will be added in the future.

**TIP #1:** Are you having trouble finding that menu? The area of Thunderbird where you activate Cards View is called the ""Message List Header"". Some people choose to hide this section to reclaim a bit of vertical space. It is easy to get it back:

- Click ≡ \> View \> Layout \> tick i.e. ensure Message List Header is checked ✓

**TIP #2:** Cards View is also available when using Classic or Wide layouts.

### Step 3: Turn on “Tags” Folder Mode

There is a new Folder pane options menu also known as a “meatball” or “three horizontal dots” menu, ⋯, to the **right** of + New Message. This menu has options to show the Total message count, Folder Size and hide the _Get Messages_ and _New Message_ icons as well as hide the Local Folders and the Folder Pane Header. It also has a Folder Modes sub menu which has options for display folders in the Folder Pane as well a new option to show Tags in the Folder Pane.

If Tags are an important part of your workflow, here's how to make it easier to access them ([animated GIF](https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/08/TB-115-Activate-Tags-Folder-Mode.gif)):

- Click ⋯ to the **right** of + New Message \> Folder Modes \> tick i.e. ensure Tags is checked ""✓"". That’s it! You can also use this menu to hide Local Folders. <dl><dt>
<img alt=""tb115-turn-on-tags-folder-modes"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2023-09-07-16-28-19-481359.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">
</dt></dl>

**Tip:** Want to move your Tags up or down in the Folder Pane?

- Click ⋮ next to Tags in the Folder Pane on the left \> Move Up OR Move Down to place your Tags wherever you wish in the Folder Pane.

### Step 4: Customize The Message Header

The Message Header is the section at the top of the Message Pane where the email is displayed, showing information such as sender’s name, contact photo (which pulls from the Address Book), subject, any associated tags, and more. Configure the Message Header Settings to suit your preferences as follows ([animated GIF](https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/08/TB-115-Customize-Message-Header.gif)):

- In the Message Pane, click More ⌄ \> Customize... make it yours \> Done Before clicking Done, make it yours by deciding if you want to display a profile picture, show the sender's profile picture, sender's full address, show all headers, hide labels etc.<dl><dt>
<img alt=""400px-2023-08-31-tb115-message-header-settings"" class=""wiki-image frameless lazy"" data-original-src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2023-08-31-20-07-58-79ddb5.png"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif"" title="""">

## Why doesn’t Thunderbird follow the operating system accent colors, especially on Linux?

The Thunderbird user interface (UI) is extremely large and complicated, with many moving pieces and UI elements that the user can select, move, highlight, etc.

By default, we ship Thunderbird with its own brand identity in order to guarantee AAA color contrast and readability between foreground and background elements.

Areas like the Message List Pane, or the Folder Pane, contain many elements and icons with specific colors that need to change and adapt depending on the state of the element.

A selected element will display a different background color. If the selected element is not currently focused, it will display a different color. If the element is only focused but not selected, it will display yet another color.

These examples are just a fraction of the many variations we need to handle in every single UI element.

Allowing every Operating System, especially Linux Desktop Environments, to fully affect the Thunderbird colors continually created issues and unexpected consequences.

The amount of bug reports of users unable to properly see the reply icon with their KDE Arch Theme with Dracula accent colors is something we constantly struggled with to give a humorous but relevant example.

Even the default Ubuntu color scheme, with its orange accent color, created constant unexpected consequences.

We do not have the resources to support each variation or edge case.

Our primary focus is to guarantee that Thunderbird is always readable and usable in every configuration. Therefore, enforcing our own brand identity and keeping it consistent across operating systems allowed us to remove these unexpected breakages and reduce the number of bug reports about accessibility and visibility.

### Why does Firefox follow the OS colors?

Because the Firefox UI is mostly just a toolbar and a settings page with monochromatic line icons. It is a much simpler and self contained UI that does not need to worry about color contrast and readability, and following system colors is easy to support.

### We recommend Add-ons and Themes to customize your colors

We rebuilt the UI in order to rely entirely on CSS variables.

We did this so add-on developers can create their own themes and drastically change the look and feel of Thunderbird by tweaking a few CSS variables. This is still a work in progress and improving constantly, but we are already seeing heavily customized themes to make Thunderbird look like a native GTK application, for example.

## Why are my Thunderbird customizations broken in 115?

If your customization required changes to userChrome.css, userContent.css, or other related files, then these [userChrome\* customizations are still unsupported in 115](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/userchromecss-js-usercontent-unsupported"") (they were also unsupported in 102 and all previous releases). There may be [solutions in the forums](https://support.mozilla.org/questions/thunderbird?tagged=unsupporteduserchromecss&show=all) but please remember these are unofficial; unsupported solutions and could break at any time.

<p>A personal certificate is required for using end-to-end encryption and digital signatures with the S/MIME technology.
</p><p>A certificate consists of a key pair: a secret key and a public key. The keys will be randomly created by Thunderbird. The private key will be stored by Thunderbird, optionally protected by the <a href=""/en-US/kb/protect-your-thunderbird-passwords-primary-password"">Primary Password</a>. The public key will be included in the certificate. Before you get your certificate, the public key must be submitted to a <em>Certificate Authority</em> (CA) as part of a <em>Certificate Signing Request</em> (CSR), which Thunderbird will create for you.

# Create your public and secret key

A personal certificate is required for using end-to-end encryption and digital signatures with the S/MIME technology.

A certificate consists of a key pair: a secret key and a public key. The keys will be randomly created by Thunderbird. The private key will be stored by Thunderbird, optionally protected by the [Primary Password](\""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/protect-your-thunderbird-passwords-primary-password"").

Before you get your certificate, the public key must be submitted to a _Certificate Authority_ (CA) as part of a _Certificate Signing Request_ (CSR), which Thunderbird will create for you.

1. Click ≡ \> Account Settings\> End-To-End Encryption for the desired email account or identity.
2. Scroll down to **S/MIME** : click Generate and save a CSR file as…

First, select a directory and a filename for the CSR text. Take note of the directory and the filename because in the next step, [Get a certificate using your public key from your Certificate Authority (CA)](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/instructions-smime-certificate-using-csr#w_get-a-certificate-using-your-public-key-from-your-certificate-authority-ca), you will submit this file to a CA.
