It seems that all the emails are in Thunderbird, but all the old email show read and tags are removed.  I have personal email account, 2 hobby email account, my wife's email account, and now my Dad's email account in Thunderbird.  How can I make sure that all the email are being saved on my computer?  Is there a way to retag the emails that were changed without having to do it one at a time?  Thank you very much for your help.

This problem is giving me fits. I purchased MS 365 email accounts through godaddy, and I like to use TB for all my emails which have yahoo, etc. They all work fine. </p><p>Now one of my MS365 emails sends and receives fine. The other will not send, but receives fine. When using MS's web client, it works fine. When using my ipad, it works fine. The issue seems to be some sort of TB setting. After trying for weeks to fix it myself, I finally gave up and called godaddy email support. We went through the exchange settings, server settings, and everything is set correctly. The working email has the identical settings as the non sending email (expect for the different email name of course). It is a mystery why one would work and not the other. The issue seems to be in the outgoing SMTP settings. I am using IMAP settings for both email addresses. </p><p>I have no clue how to get this going. I assume separate outgoing settings for each email is appropriate. Right? If not, then what email to I use? </p><p>Next Sec. Connection: Normal or Oauth2? The working email uses Normal. </p><p>When I make sever changes, do I need to restart TB? Or does it take affect immediately? </p><p>Any help would be very much appreciated. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1580199;,Squirmie

I see it only when I'm trying to get something done, obviously, like composing an email or replying to one, for the most part, but also when trying to work my way up the new emails (I generally read them from oldest to newest.)  I'll hit delete, and nothing happens, and there's no response to mouse or keyboard input.  Most often, it just stops responding while I'm typing.  I'm a touch-typist, and when I look up to check for errors, the thing is frozen at a line previous, then it suddenly fills in what I typed while it wasn't responding. </p><p>I'm running version 102.10.0, and Linux Mint 21.1 as my O.S.  I know there's a .json file that would give a lot of info about Tbird, but I don't know which one it is... let me know and I'll post it, if it's needed. </p><p>I just migrated from Windows 10 to Linux exclusively... had it with Windows nonsense.  Tbird ran flawlessly at first, but the lockup issue is happening more frequently with time/use. </p><p>Any ideas of what might be a likely culprit would be greatly appreciated! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",kharrisma
