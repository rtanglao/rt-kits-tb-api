This occurred after I was blocked by <a href=""http://Optonline.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Optonline.net</a> for sending out an email that was too large a file. I tried to reach them but could not. Do not know if this had anything to do with this. A coincidence?? i tried setting up a new email address but get the same message.... Any thoughts?  Thanks for any help.  p.s. I have been using Thunderbird since Outlook Express. Great email program. Too bad no individual support. I always wondered as I would pay a monthly fee.... </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1579382;,artieg

Years down the road, TB continues to get obvious and easy to rate emails wrong generating both false positives and negatives.  No matter how many times I mark as spam or not-spam, years later, TB still throws a ton of my reply notifications in the junk folder and serves me nigerian scams on a platter in my inbox.  The feature is so bad, it's actually a time saver for me to turn it off. </p><p>Is there an addon that replaces TB's spam system that works better or do I just need to run with no app spam control? </p><p>Thanks for your time! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1579292;1579293;1579391;,Schwim

If I press Cancel, the program closes, then when I open the program again, this time the main window of the program opens in the back window and the defined mail accounts appear. The small password window appears again, but if I press Cancel, I can open mails in mail accounts. The little password screen comes up again and again, but every time I press Cancel, I can use Thunderbird and open emails. Therefore, defining a ""Master Password"" is meaningless. I think there is an opening. When the master password is entered incorrectly or the program you click Cancel, the program should shut itself down completely and should not show/display the defined mail accounts. My e-mail account is ferhatgurgen@msn.com, I can also send related images. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1579291;,ferhatgurgen
