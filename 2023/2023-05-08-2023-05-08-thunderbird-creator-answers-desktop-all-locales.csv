For years, I saved them in Documents/Thunderbird for easy backup with SyncToy.  I am finally transitioning from laptop running Windows 7 to another laptop running Windows 10.  The Windows 10 laptop previously had a hard drive failure and since it was mostly used for web browsing at that time, we replaced it with a small 128 GB drive so I store all files on external drive. </p><p>First issue: last May I set up fresh Thunderbird folder, renaming the bulky previous folder  and didn't find out until last week that both folders stopped saving to the Thunderbird folder 5/22/2022, almost a year ago.  Today is 5/08/2023. </p><p>Resulting in related issue on Windows 10 laptop: When I started dragging new emails into local folders, I found that no Local Folder has a date more recent than 5/22/2022. Went back to Windows 7 laptop and all the recently saved emails are in Local Folders. </p><p>When checking storage, Windows 7 showed as being in C:\Users\Name\AppData\Thunderbird\Roaming\Profiles\ default I'm guessing it was inadvertently changed.  So I made new folder syncing the AppData folder with the Documents/Thunderbird folder and copied it to the Windows 10 AppData Thunderbird folder, then set it as the local storage folder.  STILL have no recently saved emails in Local Folders.  I went back and followed the instructions on this link as well: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer</a> </p><p>I've synced and copied several sets of folders to no avail.  I KNOW the emails exist on the Windows 7 laptop but I cannot find where or how to save or transfer emails from May 2022 to May 2023.  What am I missing? </p><p>One thing I can't quite understand is that Account Settings\ Copies &amp; Folders archives options shows Local Folders on drop down list also showing archives on the 3 email accounts I download into Thunderbird but it will NOT let me choose Local Folders.  None are grayed out but the Local option is simply not allowed.  This is true on both laptops.  </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help in something that is normally so easy.
