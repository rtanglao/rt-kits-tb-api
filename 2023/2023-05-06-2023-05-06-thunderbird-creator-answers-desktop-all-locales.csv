Instead, it just keeps pounding on the server which eventually blocks my IP address and then I'm stuck without email until I call my ISP support to unblock my IP. I can't just enter passwords in a field on a screen with thunderbird because there is no such screen. I have to wait for authentication to fail and then it asks for a password. This is how new accounts and password changes have always worked with thunderbird, but, apparently, not anymore.  </p><p>This is driving me bonkers. Please help.
