I cannot find a 64 bit verson for Windows 10.  But I keep reading there is one available. So which is it?  The reason is because when I sen a email, I click Send.  And a lot of times, I get the message and it just hangs and stops.  That's why I hoping for a 64 bit. Thank you so much for your time. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1578432;,flynby
