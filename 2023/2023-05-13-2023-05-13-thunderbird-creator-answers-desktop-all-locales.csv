I have a sub-folder of Garry named ""JunkMail"". I'm not certain but I think that I must have created it for troubleshooting the issue with Garry's emails going to Junk Mail. I refer to that folder as GJunk.  Here's what I need to understand better: 1. Is it possible that TB, not I, created GJunk? 2. Regardless how it was created, will emails that I mark as Junk and ones that TB automatically classifies as Junk, be moved to GJunk? 3. I think that there are some folders that TB creates automatically, right? Like Inbox, Trash, Sent. Is JunkMail another of those folders that TB creates automatically? </p><p>For troubleshooting, I sent an email to myself and marked it as Junk. It didn't get moved anywhere, it's still in Inbox. Later I sent another email to myself. It didn't get automatically marked as Junk. </p><p>Thanks for your help. SweetTasha </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1580393;1580428;,sweettasha

So far, so good. During this process, I changed the sound volume of my Mac using the keyboard buttons, which are right above the Backspace key. So I wasn't precise enough and hit the Backspace key while Thunderbird was archiving. That was a bad idea, because Thunderbird then started to delete all selected messages at the same time as it was archiving them! I was able to recover some e-mail from the Trash afterwards. </p><p>So I'd suggest that Thunderbird only allow one command to be executed at a time, lest they interfere with each other. Otherwise, I love Thunderbird. </p><p>Thanks for looking into this, regards, </p><p>Arthur </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1580305;1580306;,anacond23

Gmail does not work well. Occasionally headers are downloaded, which does not matter much.
