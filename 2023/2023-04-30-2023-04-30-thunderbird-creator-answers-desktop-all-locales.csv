A family member let Defender ""remove"" it, while I would've left it alone and then come here to isolate it or somehow bottle it up.   </p><p>My questions are this.  Was this from an email stored in Thunderbird, or was it from something one of my kids opened up?  And second, I'm guessing Defender did damage in removing it and my Tbird is now corrupt.  If it is, should I do a back up emails, remove the program and re-install?  Could this have been a false positive?   </p><p>Thanks in advance!   </p><p>messages posted by Defender as to where the trojan was: file: C:\Users\Computer\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\9c9oqfbp.default\Mail\<a href=""http://pop.optonline.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.optonline.net</a>\Inbox-&gt;(part56947:Statment-459685.html) file: C:\Users\Computer\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\9c9oqfbp.default\Mail\<a href=""http://pop.optonline.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.optonline.net</a>\Inbox-&gt;(part56589:Statment-2564896.html) </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1578260;1578271;1578286;1578316;1578394;,w2dsx
