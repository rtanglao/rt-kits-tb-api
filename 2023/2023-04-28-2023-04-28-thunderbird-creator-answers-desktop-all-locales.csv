A few weeks ago, our email service went out and when it came back on, the POP3/SMTP server links weren't working.

Found that TB had a new folder listed under IMAP, so migrated all my old folders into that new IMAP folder, but no matter what I do, they are not recognized, and Inbox will only load about 3 weeks of emails.  Anyone know what the deal here is, or how I get TB to recognize my legacy folders? </p><p>The funny thing is, when I move them over and then restart, for an instant, they all show up, then a few seconds later, they disappear.
