I downloaded the emails to Thunderbird and cleared my inbox. 45 days later, after missing the window to retrieve emails from the gmail server, the boss emailed me threatening to sue me. I am trying to get the emails back to the org's gmail without luck. I'm using a macbook air. </p><p>What I've done/checked: Opening up Thunderbird from Applications, ports and IMAP/POP/OAuth2 stuff seems to match. I've tried copying the emails (they are in the Local Folders, and there are 49,500 emails) without any luck; I've added another gmail just for the transfer to see whether the org server was preventing the downloads, but even with a brand new gmail it won't copy more than 3,000 emails before it stops working.  </p><p>Questions: 1) It seems that given the large volume of emails something (maybe gmail) is preventing the emails from being copied back into the org email (or really any gmail). Is there a way to fix this? </p><p>2) Is there another way I can share/copy the emails via some other device/program that will allow the org to read and access the emails (i.e, external hard drive, but not sure what format the export would need to be for them to be able to access/read the emails?) </p><p>3) Last resort: is there a way to make an account/profile in Thunderbird that will allow my boss to access the one Local Folder on her own laptop, without having access to the other emails on my Thunderbird account? I tried making a profile but it just asked for a new email and didn't give me the option of selecting accessibility.  </p><p>Appreciate any help as I'm totally lost, thanks! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1579801;1579879;1579971;1580011;1580139;1580145;1580161;,magdalenak.mft
