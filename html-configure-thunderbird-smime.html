<h1 id=""w_create-your-public-and-secret-key"">Create your public and secret key</h1>
<p>A personal certificate is required for using end-to-end encryption and digital signatures with the S/MIME technology.
</p><p>A certificate consists of a key pair: a secret key and a public key. The keys will be randomly created by Thunderbird. The private key will be stored by Thunderbird, optionally protected by the <a href=""/en-US/kb/protect-your-thunderbird-passwords-primary-password"">Primary Password</a>. The public key will be included in the certificate. Before you get your certificate, the public key must be submitted to a <em>Certificate Authority</em> (CA) as part of a <em>Certificate Signing Request</em> (CSR), which Thunderbird will create for you.
</p>
<ol><li> Click <span class=""button"">≡</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Account Settings</span>&gt; <span class=""menu"">End-To-End Encryption</span> for the desired email account or identity.
</li><li> Scroll down to <strong>S/MIME</strong>: click <span class=""button"">Generate and save a CSR file as…</span>
</li></ol>
<p>First, select a directory and a filename for the CSR text. Take note of the directory and the filename because in the next step, <a href=""#w_get-a-certificate-using-your-public-key-from-your-certificate-authority-ca"">Get a certificate using your public key from your Certificate Authority (CA)</a>, you will submit this file to a CA.
</p><p>Second, you will be asked several questions about the cryptographic type and strength of the S/MIME certificate that you wish to obtain. Use the defaults unless you are an expert with specific requirements.
</p><p>After you have answered all the questions, Thunderbird will randomly generate a new key pair. Please be patient. This is an intensive calculation process. During the process, Thunderbird may appear to be stuck for a few seconds, but it should be done within a minute on modern computers.
</p><p>Thunderbird will show a confirmation after the operation has completed.
</p>
<h1 id=""w_get-a-certificate-using-your-public-key-from-your-certificate-authority-ca"">Get a certificate using your public key from your Certificate Authority (CA)</h1>
<p>The next step is to contact a CA of your choice. If you are associated with a company or an organization, you may wish to ask your staff which CA you should use. If you are acting as an individual, you may wish to search the web for CAs that issue S/MIME certificates and that accept a CSR (At this time, Thunderbird does not recommend any specific CA).
</p><p>The process to obtain a certificate may require you to set up a user account with a CA, register your personal details, set up a payment method, and usually requires verification of your email address.
</p><p>Eventually, the CA should ask you to submit your CSR. At this point, open the file from the previous step, ""Create your public and secret key"", that Thunderbird had saved earlier. Your computer should show you the contents of the file. The first line of the file will contain the text: ""<code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----</code>"". 
</p><p>Please select the full contents of the file, and use the copy command to copy all of the text. Then navigate back to your CA's website (for example to the web form in your browser, on the CA's web page, which asks you to  submit the CSR), and paste the text, and continue.
</p><p>After you have submitted your file successfully to the CA, it should notify you that the certificate has been issued or will be issued soon. It may offer you the certificate for download immediately or at a later time, or send it to you by email.
</p><p>Save the certificate file you have received from your CA to and remember where you saved it. If you are using Firefox, it will be saved in the download directory configured in your Firefox settings (e.g. your <strong>Downloads</strong> folder).
</p><p>If you are downloading from a web page using your browser, check whether that page lists additional intermediate certificates, which you also might have to download.
</p>
<div class=""note"">Note: If the CA is delivering the certificate to you in a file with a filename extension <em>.p12</em> or <em>.pfx</em>, it may indicate that the CA did not use the key that you had submitted, but rather generated a secret key on their systems. This may not be what you want.</div>
<h1 id=""w_import-the-certificate-into-certificate-manager-and-back-it-up"">Import the certificate into Certificate Manager and back it up</h1>
<ol><li> Click <span class=""button"">≡</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Account Settings</span>&gt; <span class=""menu"">End-To-End Encryption</span> for the email account or identity you used earlier.
</li><li> Click <span class=""button"">Manage S/MIME Certificates</span>. If the <strong>Certificate Manager</strong> window is too small, drag its lower right corner to increase the window size.
</li><li> <strong>Certificate Manager</strong> has five tabs at the top. Click the <span class=""button"">People</span> tab &gt; <span class=""button"">Import</span> button at the bottom. Select the file that you have obtained from the CA, and confirm. If the import was successful, no further information will be shown, you will simply return to the Certificate Manager window. Because Thunderbird has stored the corresponding secret key (created during the initial steps of this process), Thunderbird should have been able to combine it with the certificate you just imported.
</li><li> If your CA offered you additional intermediate (or subordinate) certificates to download, click the <span class=""button"">Authorities</span> tab, click the <span class=""button"">Import</span> button, and import them one after the other. Note that when importing a CA in this place, Thunderbird will offer you to mark a CA as trusted, and also warn you about the associated risks. Please leave the checkboxes unchecked, do NOT check them. Confirm by clicking <span class=""button"">OK</span> which will import the intermediate CA certificate without explicitly trusting it. (Explanation: It isn't necessary to assign explicit trust to an intermediate certificate, as it is used only to discover a pathway from a person's certificate to a trusted root CA certificate.)
</li><li> Still in <strong>Certificate Manager</strong>, click <span class=""button"">Your Certificates</span>. You should see your new personal certificate in the list.
</li><li> Before you exit the <strong>Certificate Manager</strong>, it is crucial to securely backup your key and certificate to a different disk:
<ol><li> Select the entry that shows your new personal certificate, and click <span class=""button"">Backup</span>. 
</li><li> Select the directory and the filename in which the backup will be stored. 
</li><li> Then, follow the steps shown on screen, which includes defining a password of your choice to protect the backup file, to complete the backup procedure. Make sure to save the backup file to an appropriate location, such as a flash drive on which you keep important backups, and save the password somewhere secure like your password manager.
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<h1 id=""w_configure-thunderbird-to-use-smime-security"">Configure Thunderbird to use S/MIME security</h1>
<ol><li> Click <span class=""button"">≡</span> &gt; <span class=""menu"">Account Settings</span>&gt; <span class=""menu"">End-To-End Encryption</span> for the email account or identity you used earlier.
</li><li> In the section below the <strong>S/MIME heading</strong>, you will find two selection boxes labeled <strong>Personal certificate for digital signing</strong> and <strong>Personal certificate for encryption</strong>. Click the <span class=""button"">Select...</span> button on the right. 
</li><li> A list will be shown with your personal certificates for this email address. The certificate that you have just obtained should be offered in that list. Select it and confirm it. Thunderbird may ask you to use the same certificate for both encryption and signing, which usually you should confirm.
</li></ol>
<p>Now you should be able to use your personal certificate for sending digitally signed email. Recipients of your signed email should be able to send you encrypted email using the S/MIME technology, as long as the certificate has not expired. Once the certificate expires, you will have to repeat the procedure to obtain a new personal certificate.
