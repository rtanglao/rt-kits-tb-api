Google TRANSLATION follows:
Hello good. I'm having a problem with a Microsoft 365 for business account.
</p><p>It does let me read emails and it syncs fine, but it won't let me send them.
I get the error:
""Login to 'Microsoft 365' account failed.
The login to the server <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> with the username xxx@xx.es has failed.""
</p><p>If I hit retry, it comes back out. If I click on change password, this message appears again and if I click on cancel, the following message appears:
""Message sending error.
Sending the message failed.
Unable to identify outgoing (SMTP) server <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>. Check the password and check the 'Identification method' in 'Account settings | Outgoing server (SMTP)'.""
</p><p>The password is correct. I have tried to eliminate it in the thunderbird options and then when I click to send the email it asks me for the password and to perform Microsoft two-step authentication. It authenticates me correctly but after a few seconds I get that login error message again. I have changed the password in Microsoft, I have deleted it in thunderbird, I have logged in again and nothing. All equal.
</p><p>The configuration is correctly detected by Thunderbird when I select the IMAP mail mode.
The configuration is the following for the outgoing mail server:
Server name: <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>
Port: 587
Connection security: STARTTLS
Authentication method: OAut2
Username: my well-written email.
</p><p>Within Microsoft settings (I'm the administrator), I have the Authenticated IMAP and SMTP option enabled. In the Azure configuration, I have the application correctly created, with its ID and the 4 permissions it asks for have been approved at the administrator level. In the connection log of that application, it appears that I have been logged in correctly when Thunderbird asks me for the credentials.
</p><p>I'm running out of ideas. I have contacted Microsoft support but they tell me that they do not support other applications and that I should look for my life (with kinder words). What else can I look at, what else can I check?
</p><p>I would appreciate some help and many thanks in advance&nbsp;:D

</p><p>0. Not sure if the  book antiqua font issue is the issue here (it might indeed but could just as well not be font related) but I suppose it can't hurt to try uninstalling that font and also trying re-installing that font.
</p><p>Assuming fiddling with the fonts doesn't fix it:
</p><p>Have you tried the following standard Thunderbird troubleshooting steps?
</p><p>1. disabling all 3rd party add-ons including the add-ons that you appear to have installed based on the screenshot i.e. your RTL and spelling add-ons?
</p><p>2. sometimes 1. is not enough in that case try Thunderbird Trouble Shoot mode:

1. your email was setup in IMAP 2. you created subfolders of your inbox 3. you deleted your IMAP account on ATT's server 4. You created a new POP Account in Thunderbird

</p><p>My guess (and it's only a guess because email servers are varied in how they are implemented and when you deleted your IMAP account is ATT's email server might have deleted your IMAP email in Thunderbird ) is that you might have your  inbox subfolder email in your Thunderbird profile in the IMAP section of the profile. assuming you didn't delete your Thunderbird profile as well.

As the settings were identical, there was an overlap of the old provider's emails and I lost everything.
Is there a way to recover the emails from the old provider in a Thunderbird folder?
</p><p><strong>My Answer in English</strong>
</p><p>&gt;1. When migrating a site, I made backups of the server's e-mails.
Perhaps you can get the missing email from the backup? Or switch the DNS back to the old server, get the email and copy the old emails to a Thunderbird local folder and switch the DNS back to the new server?
</p><p>&gt;2. Is there a way to recover the emails from the old provider in a Thunderbird folder?
</p><p>If you saved the email to a local folder on Thunderbird you can get the email from TB's local folder
</p><p>If you didn't then:
I believe that if you use IMAP and the email is not on the new server then when the new server connects it will erase the old email in Thunderbird's IMAP folders. This is how IMAP works; this not a Thunderbird issue.
</p><p>Hope that helps a wee bit!

</p><p><em><strong>Finding/Using Shadow Copies</strong></em>
</p><p>You can use a utility program to search inside restore points to try to locate an old file that's usable. (Please do NOT try to use the built-in Windows System Restore for this because you probably would lose data.) Here are the steps:
</p><p>(1) Set Windows to show hidden files and folders:
</p><p><a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14201/windows-show-hidden-files"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14201/windows-show-hidden-files</a>
</p><p>(2) Download and run one of these two programs:
</p>
<ul><li> ShadowExplorer: <a href=""http://www.shadowexplorer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shadowexplorer.com/</a>
</li><li> System Restore Explorer: <a href=""http://nicbedford.co.uk/software/systemrestoreexplorer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nicbedford.co.uk/software/systemrestoreexplorer/</a>
</li></ul>
<p>Within the most recent restore point shown in the program, you can explore along this path to see whether you can find a shadow copy of your profile:
</p><p>\Users\<em>your-user-name</em>\AppData\<strong>Roaming</strong>\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\
</p><p>(3) Check in the <strong>bookmarkbackups</strong> folder of each profile for older backups. You can export interesting files to a convenient location such as your currently live desktop. 
</p><p>If you find a promising candidate, check out this article: <a href=""/en-US/kb/restore-bookmarks-from-backup-or-move-them"" rel=""nofollow"">Restore bookmarks from backup or move them to another computer</a> -- you'll use the Choose File option at the bottom of the Restore menu to grab the file you exported.

</p><p>I suggest:
</p><p>1. Trying Windows Safe mode 
2. Doing a malware check with malware bytes or equivalent software
3. If the above doesn't work, please  consider uninstalling Avast (because disabling antivirus often  doesn't remove it 100%) and using Windows built-in anti-virus protection and let us know if any of the above 3 help.

</p><p>Writing a complex modern web site is difficult for software developers. I doubt that ""Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol"" in the  firewall or Firefox update has anything to do with it&nbsp;; my guess is that was a coincidence. It could also be that the National Lottery folks changed their coding and broke Chrome but that also seems unlikely. If this hasn't been done already, I'd say contact the National Lottery folks.

</p><p>Second, why is this just Firefox? The technical details are complicated but the high level is pretty simple: caching is complicated and each browser behaves somewhat differently; with the particular way that Twitter had their site set up, Chrome, Safari, and Edge don’t cache this data but Firefox will. It’s not that we’re right and they’re wrong. It’s just a normal difference in browser behavior. There is a standard way to ensure that data isn’t cached, but until recently Twitter didn’t use it, so they were just dependent on non-standard behavior on some browsers.

</p><p>Please clarify your issue:
</p><p>Is your issue that it takes 10 seconds-10 minutes to unlock your Firefox because you have to enter your Firefox master password every time you start Firefox? &lt;--- [A]
</p><p>It should take more than a few seconds to unlock Firefox using the master password feature.
</p><p>Some thoughts that might be helpful assuming [A] is actually your issue:
</p>
<ol><li> I don't use the Master Password feature; I just use the OS's built-in security features; would it be possible for you to do this?
</li><li> If you disable all your Firefox add-ons  does the Master Password unlock delay disappear?

</p><p><strong>QUOTE</strong>
</p><p>You should not need to crash Firefox to restore a session.
</p><p>Firefox 63 doesn't have the <strong>browser.showQuitWarning</strong> preference any more, meaning Firefox will automatically save your session (assuming it is not set to clear history) and then executes your choice of startup behaviors:
</p><p>(A) Optional/manual session restore (menu):
</p>
<ul><li> menu button &gt; Restore Previous Session
</li><li> (menu bar) History &gt; Restore Previous Session
</li></ul>
<p><em>With this approach, you choose whether to restore your previous session at startup instead of at the previous shutdown.</em>
</p><p>(B) Automatic session restore (Options page):
</p>
<ul><li> Windows: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Options
</li><li> Mac: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Firefox menu) &gt; Preferences
</li><li> Linux: ""3-bar"" menu button (or Edit menu) &gt; Preferences
</li><li> Any system: type or paste <strong>about:preferences</strong> into the address bar and press Enter/Return to load it
</li></ul>
<p>It's the first checkbox on the page (""General"" panel), ""Restore previous session"".

</p><p>My guess is that writing python workflows on Alfred for OS X is something so obscure it won't be prioritized highly (and I doubt that depending on the locking behaviour of a sqlite database is also not common and not something firefox developers ever thought others would care about!). But that's only a guess based on the fact I've never heard of anybody doing this before&nbsp;:-)&nbsp;!

1167855,1238343,https://support.mozilla.org/question/1238343,"<p>Hi ongaku, thanks for your patience on this issue
</p><p>On my Windows 10 computer the following steps (I'm not sure what order I did them in)
</p><p>1. Windows 10 Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors. Scroll down and select the “Dark” option under the “Choose your app mode” section. (I've also checked ""Automatically pick an accent color from my background"")
</p><p>2. in Firefox about:addons -&gt; Themes, select Default
</p><p>3. in Firefox about:config set ui.systemUsesDarkTheme to 0 as per  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1238343#answer-1167155"" rel=""nofollow"">the fab jscher's instructions above</a> above. Unfortunately as always changing anything in about:config can lead to things breaking at any moment and there's no real support for about:config changes. But hopefully you can remove the above:config tweak in a future release.
</p><p>Anyhow the above works for me (see screenshot)  and the tab icons are visible and tab text is white.  I believe if you ""play around"" with Windows 10 settings and can figure out how to select the default Firefox theme (not sure why you can't, perhaps it's another Firefox theme you installed or a Firefox  add-on you installed; check out <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/disable-or-remove-add-ons"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>,<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a>,<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">3</a> for help on this) you can get something readable and that you like.
</p><p>Finally copying and pasting about:support into a reply on this thread should help further if the above doesn't work.
</p><p>Cheers!
...Roland
</p><p>p.s. over the 9 years i've worked on thunderbird and firefox support, people always have issues with the dark theme on Windows, has it got better? what do people use dark mode for&nbsp;? i've heard folks use it because of movie editing and photo editing and of course personal preference, my personal preference is all things bright even when editing photos but of course your mileage may vary

</p><p>I read your mind and figured you had tried that add-on and I was right&nbsp;:-) 
</p><p>Seriously, the Firefox for Android team is trying like the Firefox for Mac, Windows and Linux team to figure out the way forward to ""square the circle"" and have a fast, modern browser with WebExtensions that goes beyond what is possible today with WebExtensions to give Firefox users and developers the extensibility they need.
</p><p>Theming and general skinning of the FF for Android browser with Webextension add-ons is something the FF for Android team hasn't had the time or resources to consider in detail until now as far as I can tell. 
</p><p>They do know that in order to start the process of ""squaring the circle"" they have to switch FF for Android add-ons to in 57 to Web Extensions just like FF Desktop. That's all I know&nbsp;:-)

</p><p>If you referring to this previous question:
<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1037538"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1037538</a>
your question was answered by an employee (although our volunteers are equally knowledgeable sometimes more!)
</p><p>Anyhow Facebook changes their website all the time which breaks Firefox and other software.
</p><p>In order for us to help you please let us know:
</p>
<ol><li>your android tablet or phone make and model
</li><li>your version of Firefox for Android. We recommend you use the latest Firefox for Android 42 that was released Tue Nov 3
</li><li>your android operating system version (e.g. lollipop 5, kitkat 4.3 etc)
</li><li>do you have a 3rd party keyboard like swype installed? sometimes these sorts of things break Firefox
</li><li> what you did, what happened and what happened. I understand you were simply leaving a Facebook comment but if there are any other details missing please provide them.
</li></ol>
<p>Cheers!

</p><p><br>
Firefox for iOS version 1.0 doesn't sync bookmarks from Firefox on  your computer; just history, passwords and recent tabs.
</p><p>Firefox for iOS Version 1.1 will add the ability to sync your iOS phone or tablet  with the bookmarks from Firefox on your computer. It will be out before the end of the year if things go well (perhaps even sooner!).

</p><p>Here are a few questions we have for you, but please include any other feedback:
</p>
<ol><li>Briefly describe what you expected the homepage in Firefox to be like.
</li><li>How does the homepage in Firefox compare to your expectations?
</li><li>Is anything missing from the ‘homepage in Firefox’ experience?
</li><li>Was it easy or difficult to set your homepage in Firefox?
</li><li>What is one thing you would change about the homepage in Firefox?
</li></ol>
<p>Ready to give it a try? Here’s how it works:
</p>
<ol><li>First, allow third-party app installation on your Android. Go to your Android Settings and enable 'unknown sources' (usually under ""Security"").
</li><li>Download and install Firefox for Android Nightly at <a href=""http://nightly.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">nightly.mozilla.org</a>
</li><li> Open Firefox for Android Nightly, then in the menu, tap Settings -&gt; Customize -&gt; Home -&gt; Set a Homepage 
</li><li> Enter a homepage by either typing in a URL, or put a check mark next to  ‘Use current tab’. 
</li><li> Finally tap ‘OK’ to set your homepage.
</li></ol>
<p>You’ll will see your homepage every time you restart Firefox for Android Nightly.
</p><p>Cheers!

</p><p>Yup it's a problem in Firefox for Android 37 and 38 beta. It seems to be fixed in FF40 nightly. In other words if you go to <a href=""http://nightly.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">nightly.mozilla.org</a> and download Firefox for Android nightly version 40 and the Flash Player addon and request the desktop site (Firefox for Android Menu | Request Desktop Site)  it works fine on the Nexus 9. 
</p><p>Curiously I don't seem to have this problem on Firefox for Android 37 on a Samsung S6 Edge. I will investigate further  and file a bug (even if it turns out to be a Verge issue and not a Firefox issue)
</p><p>In the meantime, as a workaround, you can go to the Verge YouTube channel and play the videos from the YouTube app.

</p><p>This is a Firefox for Android forum specifically so we don't focus on general Android issues. Therefore I am locking this thread.
</p><pre>I suggest contacting Google or your manufacturer (e.g. Samsung or HTC or Sony etc) for general Android support.

<p>For your problem of exiting safe mode, I found the following with a quick Google search:

</p><p>Glad you solved your problem.
</p><p>You can exit Firefox using the normal Android operating system process which is:
</p>
<ol><li> tap the soft button next to the home button and then 
</li><li> tap the ""X"" or swipe left on Firefox 
</li><li> And finally if you don't mind clearing some or all of your data on exit, you can add the exit button back to the Firefox menu by following the instructions here:

</p><p>Please be nice to the folks here. Most are volunteers and James is a one  of volunteers (thanks James!).
</p><p>Due to the nature of the Android operating system if your web browser or other app *could* use  a permission like camera or geo location in the future, you have to approve those permissions twice:
</p>
<ol><li>  when installing the app AND 
</li><li> then on any website that uses those permissions, Firefox asks for your permission for that individual websites. 
</li></ol>
<p>I wish Android was different and you could approve (or deny) those permissions the first time they are used on an individual website (i.e. #2 only) but there's nothing we can do about this.
</p><p>I've heard that if you root your Android phone (which I don't recommend unless you are technical) that you can control the permissions in the way you want (i.e. through some unsupported third party app, automatically deny and or eliminate the permission request when installing apps).

</p><p>Just tried all 3 options again (last time was on a Samsung S5) for <a href=""http://www.animeid.tv"" rel=""nofollow"">www.animeid.tv</a> on my HTC One M7 running Android Kitkat 5 &amp; Firefox 36.0.1

</p>
<ol><li> For DailyMotion I think this could be a bug in Firefox or more likely a bug in the way the video player was coded by the animeid web developers since <a href=""http://DailyMotion.com"" rel=""nofollow"">DailyMotion.com</a> videos work fine in fullscreen if you watch them from <a href=""http://dailymotion.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dailymotion.com</a>
</li><li> For ios: this is of course coded for iOS (which uses the same browser engine as Chrome) so I am not surprised it doesn't work
</li><li> For Videobam - I have no idea why it takes so long to load. Might be a bug in Videobam or again the way the web developers have coded it.
</li><li>  ""I compare it with chrome android and for my surprise I'm able to watch the videos normally"" - This is unfortunately not a surprise; this happens a lot because many mobile sites are coded by web developers to only work on Safari and Chrome and in doing so are not compatible with webstandards (we call this ""webcompat""). I would suggest that you file a support request with <a href=""http://animeid.tv"" rel=""nofollow"">animeid.tv</a> to fix their coding and also that you file a webcompat issue at <a href=""https://webcompat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webcompat.com/</a>
</li><li> ""I have a doubt if Mozilla by default has installed flash player or not. And in the negative case: where can I get the apk?."" - You are right, Mozilla doesn't install flash by default. Please install the flash player by following our instructions here:  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-watch-flash-videos-firefox-android"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-watch-flash-videos-firefox-android</a> and here: <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/installing-flash-player-android-devices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/installing-flash-player-android-devices.html</a>

</p><p>Perhaps you are right, it's perhaps not a Cyanogen Mod problem but it's still worth a look in the Cyanogen forums I think because  when using a non factory ROM like Cyanogen Mod there's always the possibility that things will break in weird ways especially on older not so popular phones.

</p><p>Big thanks for the test email message which is super helpful.
</p><p>I tested this with both Chrome and Firefox 36 on a Note 4 with Android 4.4.4 kitkat  and neither played  the MP3 Google Voice voicemail file  linked from your test email in the browser.
</p><p>Both Android Chrome and Android Firefox 36 downloaded the MP3 which could then be played by the Android music player.
</p><p>So it sounds like it's a bug in Google Voice since I see the same behaviour in Chrome for Android and Firefox for Android do you agree?

</p><p>tl;dr:<strong>Jscher2000 is right. As of Android 4.4.4 and up, the Google Android Operating System on all devices except HTC devices wants to invoke some sort of app when you press and hold down the home button and there is no way to disable the ""press and hold down the home button"" functionality.</strong>
</p><p>There are workarounds like deleting all the apps that provide press and hold down home button functionality (like Google Now, Firefox and many other apps) but there is no way on Google ""vanilla android"" like on Google Nexus Devices and on Samsung devices like the Note 4 and S5 to disable the prompt when pressing and holding down the home button
</p><p><strong>There is a way to disable the press and home button functionality on HTC Devices (Go to Android Settings|Display, gestures and buttons| Home | tap on ""Swipe for Google Now, press and hold for menu"".</strong>
</p><p>So you are stuck with press and hold the home button invoking an app unless you switch to HTC 
or Google or Samsung add a preference to disable it like HTC did.

<ul><li> 2. steps to reproduce crash problem as per your screenshots
<ul><li> i) highlight text ""display the word 'paste'...""
</li><li> ii) copy the text
</li><li> iii) long press on 'Aaa' and then 'Aaa"" is selected
</li><li> iv) tap on combined clipboard copy/paste icon and <strong>the text 'Aaa' is copied instead the desired behaviour which is to paste ""display the word 'paste'...""</strong>
</li></ul>
</li><li> 3. to fix this, the workaround I believe is to do the following instead of 2 iv):
<ul><li> iv) tap on the checkmark icon first to make sure 'Aaa' is not selected and then long press and use the combined clipboard copy/paste icon to paste (or on some devices a Paste icon instead of the combined clipboard copy/paste icon will be shown and you can use this Paste icon). I found this workaround here: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1086933#c7:"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1086933#c7:</a>

""The ""Paste"" popup is finicky in the URLBar. Because you had a selection already, we show the ActionBar. If you would have cleared the URLBar selection and then long-pressed, you would have seen the ""Paste"" popup.""

678818,1041440,https://support.mozilla.org/question/1041440,"<p>Hi Kruk07 and hgt43
</p><p>philipp is right (thanks!) it is not possible to disable the Firefox Search Engine widget from Firefox.
</p><p>This is a general Android operating system problem with Android widgets; you can't disable or delete an Android widget without uninstalling its application e.g.. you can't disable or delete the Firefox search widget without uninstalling firefox.
</p><p>Third party solutions like SwipeLaunch Disabler and using a custom ROM or a custom launcher like the Nova Launcher may work but as far as I can tell they don't work well and they don't work on all Android phones.
</p><p>Hopefully Google will enhance the Android Operating system post 5.0 to fix this issue. Disabling widgets and deleting widgets in Android 5.0 is still not possible.
</p><p>In the meantime you can try a 3rd party solution or just live with it (and of course file a feature request bug for Firefox but I doubt there's much the Firefox developers can do to fix this.)

</p><p>2. If want you really want is to control what is displayed when you start the Firefox for Android browser then:
</p><p>You can disable top sites and bookmarks and any other tab on the Home screen.

</p><p>This gets you part way there but doesn't allow you to set your own home page.
</p><p>Please let us know if #1 or #2 works for you.

p.s. For anybody else reading this question in the future, I believe this was NOT a Firefox issue since Firefox for Android 31 works great on my Galaxy S5; it could be a mobile chipset issue but these kinds of things can't be debugged further unless we know the exact version of S5. e.g. S5 vanilla, S5 Verizon, S5 Europe, etc etc etc

535569,986796,https://support.mozilla.org/question/986796,"<p>Hi again arminus1:
</p><p>I always think it's fair to think of people and organizations to be innocent until proven guilty. We are as we have always been working on the side of the user as per our manifesto:
</p><p><a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/</a>
</p><pre>so I would appreciate you giving us a wee bit more the benefit of the doubt especially since there are no documented cases of Mozilla handing over date to governments or compromising user data. 
</pre>
<p>Firefox *does* clear your bookmarks, top sites and history when you clear browsing history. I am aware of the following issues:
</p>
<ol><li> If you have a site pinned in your Top Sites, Firefox doesn't unpin pinned Top Sites when you clear history. Pinning a site is a hard feature to discover so I doubt this is your problem. If you have pinned a site, long tap on it in Top Sites to unpin it. This seems like a bug to me. Feel free to file a bug about this at <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi</a> 
</li><li> If for some reason you have <strong>Don't keep activities</strong> checked in: <strong>Android Settings | Developer options</strong> then clearing history doesn't work in Firefox for Android. Not sure if this is an Android Operating system bug or a Firefox bug. To fix this issue, <strong>simply uncheck ""Don't keep activities""</strong> and then clearing history in Firefox will work properly. I believe we already have a bug filed about this but there's not much we can do about Android OS. I believe it's a bug to expose this to users. I have personally tested clearing private data and it works fine for me on my Galaxy Note 3 and Nexus 5, 7 and 10.
</li><li> Finally if there's some other issue around clearing history or private data, i would love to hear it and feel free to file a bug or I will file a bug for you
</li></ol>
<p>Cheers!

</p><p>Firefox is not snooping on you. It asks you for those permissions because it now allows webapps to use those multimedia capabilities; installing firefox doesn't automatically turn on the microphone or any other feature.

</p><p>Thanks for trying and confirming it's not a OpenDNS search engine setting in Firefox for Android (which means it's not a Firefox issue). 
</p><p>This means jscher2000 is right (as always, thanks jscher2000!!!! happy holidays j!) that openDNS is either a) set in your wifi router b) set by your ISP
</p><p>a) for your wifi router: ask whoever installed (it could be you or it could be your ISP; more and more ISPs install WiFi routers for customers these days; when WiFi first became popular many people installed their own WiFi routers) to remove the OpenDNS settings or configure Google DNS or some other DNS provider
</p><p>b) ask your ISP's technical support  how to disable OpenDNS and configure Google DNS or some other DNS provider

515724,981420,https://support.mozilla.org/question/981420,"<p>Hi SuperRup91:
</p><p>As the fantastic jscher2000 wrote:
""you may have OpenDNS set as your DNS service in your router, or your ISP may be using it.""
</p><p>And you may not have been aware that OpenDNS was set in your WiFi router.
</p><p>Whoever controls the network that your WiFi hooks into can change google searches or anything you browse or in this case change ""404 page not found errors"" to go to OpenDNS.  And there are two place where your network is controlled: i) your wifi router and ii) your ISP.
</p><p>Two examples:
</p><p>1. Here in Vancouver, Canada where I live, if you connect to a Shaw WiFi hotspot, then Shaw changes your searches by adding Shaw specific stuff. Not a great situation&nbsp;:-) but Shaw does that. (one could argue that this means Shaw is ""breaking the internet"") 
</p><p>2. By default Verizon configures the WiFi routers they supply with something called ""DNS assistance"" which changes DNS and again one could argue that this too ""breaks the internet"" 
</p>
<ul><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/975069#answer-493363"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/975069#answer-493363</a>

</li></ul>
<p>Therefore, I recommend you check your WiFi router and see if it has OpenDNS configured. You may have to consult your ISP's technical support to remove OpenDNS; this is most certainly not a Firefox problem; we can't help with WiFi router configuration unfortunately.
</p><p>Hope that helps!
</p><p>Happy Holidays!

</p><p>Where I am going with the above questions is that whoever controls the network that your WiFi hooks into can change google searches or anything you browse. 
</p><p>Eg. here in Vancouver, Canada where I live, if you connect to a Shaw hotspot, then Shaw changes your searches by adding Shaw specific stuff. Not a great situation&nbsp;:-) but Shaw does that. (one could argue that this means Shaw is ""breaking the internet"")
</p><p>So Verizon through their control of the network could take over searches  when you are using a WiFi hotspot whose bandwidth is provided by Verizon.

</li><li> if you take your Galaxy S4 to another wifi spot NOT run by Verizon (e.g. using another ISP to supply the bandwidth e.g. Comcast, AT&amp;T, Starbucks, etc) is your search on Firefox for Android  Google or Verizon?
</li><li> Lastly what steps are you using to start the search? Are you going to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> in Firefox for Android or are you using the built-in Firefox for Android search?

</p><p>Sorry to hear about this problem.
</p><p>Firefox for Android doesn't just switch search providers arbitrarily.
</p><p>Two guesses:
</p><p>1) You accidentally or somehow forgot that you installed an add-on that does search on Verizon by default.
</p>
<ul><li> In the Firefox for Android menu: check Tools | Add-ons and make sure you don't have a Firefox for Android add-on that makes Verizon your search provider or that Verizon is your default search provider. 
</li><li> If you do have an add-on related to Verizon, disable it
</li><li> If somehow Verizon became a search provider, long tap on Verizonand tap ""Disable""
</li></ul>
<p>2) Verizon did something strange. Not sure what they could do and how to cope with it but it's a possibility that your ISP (which I guess is Verizon) can do weird things when connected to the ISP's WiFi.
</p><p>Followup questions:
</p>
<ul><li> What Android device are you using?
</li><li> What version of Android are you using?

</p><p>Yeah I don't know about this and I don't have an Android device that supports USB storage.
</p><p>What Android device are you using and what operating system (Jellybean? Ice Cream sandwich&nbsp;?)
</p><p>I asked the Mozilla QA folks and they said Firefox for Android uses the Android platform download directory so the USB drive *should* show up if it registers properly with Android. 
</p><p>They suggested the following:
</p>
<ol><li> removing the SD card and seeing if it shows up in place of the SD card.
</li><li> perhaps changing the following preference (type ""about:config"" in the url bar without the quotation marks)
</li></ol>
<p><strong> browser.download.dir</strong>
</p><p>will fix it (<strong>WARNING:untested and unsupported but hopefully this might help</strong>)

Regardless I suggest filing a bug at (I looked but couldn't find a bug that corresponds to this):

</p><p>I work for SUMO but I am not a Firefox Developer. so unfortunately I can't resolve your question.
</p><p>This forum is not for programming questions but I don't know the right forum to ask them. I am going to email a Firefox developer who might either know the answer or who would know the appropriate place to ask this question. And I'll ask him to reply here.
